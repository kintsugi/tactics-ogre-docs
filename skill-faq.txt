{1} INTRODUCTION
----------------

This FAQ is long overdue, and serves to detail all the complexities of skill 
availability for class and level. The biggest problem posed, was how to make 
the overview understandable and easy to reference. I hope the format works for
everyone who needs to look up this info. When comparing a skill for all 
classes, the game already allows a good overview by pressing "square + >".

Note that I didn't go into detail about most TP-using skills, with the only 
exception being Meditate. Most TP-using skills are unique to classes, with 
only a few being shared among classes. There is already a Class FAQ that 
describes most of these skills, along with evaluations of them:
www.gamefaqs.com/psp/999440-tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together/faqs/62169
But since the FAQ only described human skills, I decided to decribe the
remaining humanoid & monster skills, albeit with less stylish presentation.
The guide also describes roughly what spells are available to each class.

If you have just started this game, and are mesmerized by the sheer number of
skills you can learn, you may be struck with indecision as to the correct
choices to make. In that case, allow me to redirect you to my Skill Improvement
FAQ, in particular the chapter Early-Game Advice, which can quickly help you
avoid making one of the many easy mistakes beginning players make.


{2} CLASS COMPARISON
--------------------

--- Classes by rank
I offer up what I consider to be a definitive ranking of classes, evaluated
over the totality of the game. From the short but difficult start to the long
endgame. I have strived to eliminate all subjective considerations (enjoyment,
personal preference, playstyle, etc.) so that all that remains is an objective
assessment of the classes based on their power, usefulness, versatility and
overall combat options. Short comparative summaries are included for clarity.
01/44 - LORD: Nearly all magic and weapons, all general skills, good crossover
	TP skills. Very few downsides to this class, except that it requires
	certain storyline decisions which are not ideal for the ending.
02/44 - SHAMAN: The ultimate caster. Fast and powerful. It has TP skills to
	boost its magical attacks, and access to powerful elemental spells.
03/44 - KNIGHT COMMANDER: A precursor to the Lord class, and with superior
	melee skills. Decent magic options, too.
04/44 - NINJA/KUNOICHI: Sturdy, deadly and fast. Despite coming later, it
	outcompetes Archer due to its mobility, magic and utility.
05/44 - ARCHER: Early game ranged superiority. Simple but effective. Archers
	are hailed as the most important starting class in the game.
06/44 - PRINCESS: A strong mage with melee weapon options, the game's best
	exorcist, and a decent healer/support caster to boot.
07/44 - ROGUE: Very fast, with Speedstar, Sneak Attack, Stealing, and lots of
	other TP skills. The most versatile unit in the game; frail but
	suitable for both melee & ranged.
08/44 - RUNE FENCER/VALKYRIE: The Conserve MP exploit won't become available
	until the mid game, but it makes up for its shortcomings later on,
	when its TP skills and summon magic make it a great hybrid class.
09/44 - RANGER: Becomes a powerful bow attacker with the Ji'ygla's set, but
	this is very late game, by which time magic has eclipsed ranged.
	Before this, Ranger shines with Double Attack and physical strength.
10/44 - BUCCANEER: Combines the Speedstar of a Rogue with a Ninja's Double
	Attacks. It remains inferior to both, because it has less versatility,
	and no magic.
11/44 - WICCE: A special mage class with some melee competence, and she can
	apply Spellcraft to herself without losing her ability to attack.
12/44 - ASTROMANCER: A late game recruit, but access to all Apocrypha is very
	significant. Inability to wear Winged or Sidhe Boots is a serious
	limitation, though.
13/44 - VARTAN: Good TP skills, but 6RT/square moved delays Vartan a lot.
	It's a powerful and reliable spearhead unit in the early game.
14/44 - PRIEST: Although eclipsed by Princess, her group healing is still
	superior. She is an effective support unit early on.
15/44 - FAMILIAR: Despite its humble beginnings, this class evolves into a
	fast and effective caster, with all manner of tricks up its sleeves.
16/44 - PATRIARCH/MATRIARCH: A good movement allowance for a generic mage
	class, with interesting skills, some melee ability, but its light
	armour wardrobe is less useful for a caster.
17/44 - DARK PRIEST: The poorest of the special caster classes. Despite its
	access to non-light apocrypha, its main attraction is its good
	movement allowance. Classmarks are a pain to get.
18/44 - NECROMANCER: This caster class is hailed as very speedy due to having
	the same base RT as Ninja, but most casters are only 3 points slower.
	Classmarks are a pain to get.
19/44 - LICH: A bit slow compared to other casters, but its high damage and
	many magic options make up for a lot. Converting into Lich is a pain.
20/44 - CYCLOPS: Access to a great deal of magic and lots of quirky TP skills.
	It can be built as a caster or melee attacker, and will be speedy at
	both tasks. But even monster toughness doesn't make up for its weak
	starting stats. As a 'demihuman' beast, it can use basic consumables.
21/44 - WIZARD/ENCHANTRESS: The 'starter' mage class eventually gets
	overshadowed by almost every other caster class. Engulf doesn't do
	enough to keep it competitive, due to slow TP accumulation, an issue
	that plages most caster's TP skills.
22/44 - WARLOCK/WITCH: Despite being widely seen as the first 'upgrade' over
	Wizard, it's actually a significant setback if you aren't interested in
	using a golem alongside it. It's 1RT slower, and the tiny bit of extra
	INT doesn't make up for having to level this class from scratch.
23/44 - DRAGOON: Its TP skills can slay beasts and dragons just when they start
	to pose a threat, and they can double as a ranged unit with 2-handed
	crossbows, too.
24/44 - KNIGHT: An easily overlooked class that offers great early-game options
	and versatility. Excellent for duels, assisting during rescue missions,
	holding the front line, healing and can even equip 1-handed crossbows.
	It beats some of its more powerful knightish counterparts due to being
	available early game, when the options it offers are far more useful.
25/44 - WHITE KNIGHT: This Knight type may get in trouble without Phalanx, but
	has good supporting abilites, healing, debuff removers, and a skill for
	speeding allies up. It also has a good selection of weapons to use.
26/44 - PALADIN: The last class you can recruit in postgame, it has better
	healing/support than a regular Knight, it's faster, just as tough, more
	weapon choices, and doesn't lose its attack round to get Instill Light.
27/44 - GRYPHON: The first true monster class in the list. It deserves this
	privilege for being able to fly, and having strong TP skills, such as
	HP stealing, and Windshot with its huge area of effect.
28/44 - JUGGERNAUT: It has a high starting movement allowance, and can use the
	long reach of spears to gain almost as much mobility and battlefield
	control as Ninjas, but less powerful.
29/44 - CLERIC: This unit excels in healing and exorcism, but is sorely lacking
	when those services are not in need on the battlefield. It can only
	deal good damage with a ranked cudgels skill, or Lobber bombs.
30/44 - FUSILIER: The first class to introduce the nifty and interesting Fusils
	to the game, it suffers from slowness, and comes too late to compete
	with Archer.
31/44 - WARRIOR: Melee doesn't fare very well in this game, and this unit has
	most of its skills and weaponry focused on this. Still, it's fairly
	competent nonetheless, because its attacks can inflict good damage.
32/44 - BERSERKER: On the slow side of combat, this class is specialized in
	melee effectiveness, and performs well at this if it can get its STR
	high enough. But it's not the toughest of field units.
33/44 - DIVINE KNIGHT: This flying unit is a late game support class, and it
	can be a disappointment to many players. The TP skills it uses in
	support can still be very useful, if you actually use one. Unforunately
	it's a generic-only class.
34/44 - COCKATRICE: TP skills can make a lot of difference, and this is why
	Cockatrice falls way behind Gryphon, despite being able to fly.
35/44 - TERROR KNIGHT: This unit is the slowest unit in the game, further
	hampered by heavy equipment. It's not as tough as a knight, but it can
	frighten many opponents and steal HP, which is very helpful.
36/44 - SONGSTRESS: A close range, late-game support class, and even more of a
	disappointment than Divine Knight, if you ask me. Instrument finishers
	are good when ranked up, but the only useful magic is Ardent Conga.
37/44 - HOPLITE: Very sturdy class, with access to spears. Its skills are all
	ranked skills, and it offers poor offense and support, but can run
	decent interference.
38/44 - CLAY, STONE, IRON & BALDUR GOLEM: Useful if you recruit one mid game,
	when elemental augments aren't that effective yet. But a golem's lack
	of any elemental attack is yet another limitation to this monster class
	in the late game.
39/44 - FLAME and FLOOD DRAGON: Slightly better than the other dragons because
	they can walk on lava and water, respectively.
40/44 - BEAST TAMER: A unit with mainly melee options, though it can be decent
	with blowguns. It's of little use without beast or dragon to Empower.
41/44 - ARC, DARK, CLOUD, EARTH, THUNDER, & FROST DRAGON: These dragons all
	play roughly the same. No mobility bonus, but they have Rampart Auras
	and Resonance, which can be put to good use.
42/44 - OCTOPUS: Not many maps have water within range of the frontline, and
	this monster is hampered by dry land. But when it has access, it can be
	very dangerous indeed. Situational power is highly unreliable, though.
	They make tough opponents on water maps, but are weak, impaired allies.
43/44 - HYDRA: Worse than the other dragons due to lack of Rampart Aura,
	although it reportedly has somewhat stronger attacks.
44/44 - SWORDMASTER: This is the worst class. 1 weapon option, frail in
	defense, and defensive skills singlemindedly focused on melee from
	opponents, while the dangerous enemy attacks are ranged and magic.
End results were initially based on discussions held in this thread:

Special thanks to beatumdown for providing me with some missing Golem data.


{3} EXPLANATION OF CHARACTERS
-----------------------------

Behind the skill name is usually a number between 1 and 45: this indicates at 
what level the skill can be purchased by the class, although a unit may make 
use of a skill it already purcased while in another class, even if it is too 
low level to purchase it in its new class.

Other symbols and phrases you will see in the list need to be explained:
--  means the class cannot purchase or use the skill.
[]  means the class cannot purchase, but can use the skill.
{1-handed only} means that the class can equip Axes or Fusils, but can only
    use the 1-handed versions.
{2-handed only} means that the class can equip Axes or Fusils, but can only
    use the 2-handed versions.
{Caldia fan only}  means that the class can purchase the Hammers skill, but
    can only use the female-only Caldia fan.
{Iron & Caldia fans only}  means that the class can purchase the Hammers
    skill, but can only use the male-only Iron Fan and female-only Caldia fan.
{caster only}  means the class can only use caster staves: Everything except
    Baldur Mace (+1), Damasc Mace (+1) and Sagara cudgel. Cudgel availability
    is incredibly complex, so I will occasionally write unabbreviated 
    explanations.
{ALL} means that the unit can use all the daggers, bows & crossbows.
{basic, Baldur & Damasc}  means that many classes can only use 1-handed
    bows/crossbows. For Daggers it means that the class is limited in its use
    of daggers to: Sticker (+1), Baldur Dagger (+1) and Damasc Dagger (+1).
    For cudgels there are only {Baldur & Damasc} versions, since the basic
    cudgel is a caster staff, unavailable to non-mages. Sometimes the Cursed
    weapon is equippable too.
?   means that the Resist-type skills were not extensively researched. The 
    predominant level at which the skill is purchaseable is listed, although 
    exceptions are possible per class, and have been witnessed. All classes 
    can purchase the Resist-type skills; only the exact level is uncertain.
 /  Some skills have 2 or 4 tiers of skill, and these are purchasable at 
    different levels. These level availabilities are divided with " / ", 
    going from tier 1 to tier 4. An example: The Spellstrike values for the 
    Knight class lists " 8 / 19 / [] / --". This means it can purchase 
    Spellstrike I and Spellstrike II at levels 8 & 19, respectively. It can 
    use Spellstrike III if gained from another class, but not Spellstrike IV.
n/a  means certains things in the skill overview are not actually purchaseable
    skills, but they were added nonetheless to improve the overview.

Since spells are important in the game, I will add castable spells behind each 
magic type in parentheses {}, to complete the class overview. For this, you 
must understand the following magic subtypes:
-"Missile", like Spiritsurge I-IV for Divine Magic. They can be bought in shops
and found in story battles. Rank IV versions drop in San Bronsa.
-"Indirect", like Judgement I-IV for Divine Magic.They can be bought in shops
and found in story battles. Rank IV versions drop in San Bronsa.
-"Summons", like Wisplight I-II for Divine Magic. Rank I can be bought in shops
in Palace of the Dead. Rank II versions drop in San Bronsa.
-"Apocrypha", a.k.a. Forbidden Magic, like Heavenly Judge I-II for Divine 
Magic. The Divine versions drop in San Bronsa. The Dark versions drop in Palace
of the Dead and when replaying certain story battles in world mode. The other 6
elements drop from their respective shrine guardian in story battles during the
shrines quests. This is explained in detail in the final chapter of this FAQ.
-"Instill", which includes Instill Light and Lightguard for Divine Magic. These
can be bought in shops. The offensive Instill buff only helps armed physical
attacks. It won't boost unarmed monster attacks, TP skills, magic or finishers.
-"Utility", which includes a variety of buffs and debuffs, like Silent Light, 
Boon of Swiftness, Dispel, and much more for Divine Magic. Most utility spells
can be bought in shops, but a few are restricted to special shops like Deneb's
Emporium, or Palace of the Dead. Rare utility spells drop in Palace of the Dead
and San Bronsa. The Pirate's Graveyard also has a few.
- "Exorcism", the spells Exorcism I-II exclusive to Divine Magic, which kills 
stilled undead. They are buyable in shops, rank II from Deneb.
- "Drain", the spells Drain Heart, Drain Mind, and Drain Power, exclusive to 
Dark Magic, they steal HP, MP and TP from targets, respectively. They can be
bought in shops, but Drain Power only from Deneb or Palace of the Dead shops.
- "Heal", the single-target healing spells Heal I-IV are exclusive to Divine 
Magic. They can be bought, but rank IV only drops in San Bronsa.
- "Major Heal", the area-effect healing spells Major Heal I-III are exclusive
to Divine Magic. Rank I & II are bought in shops, rank III drops in San Bronsa.

The final shop upgrade is in CODA (postgame), so you may not have full access.


{4} THE BASIC OVERVIEW & SKILL COSTS
------------------------------------

This is how the overview for each class will look. It is also a template I 
used to copy-paste onto each class. Different classes always pay the same
amount of Skill Points (SP) for skills, and these SP costs are listed below.
Some skills are purchased by any class at the same level. The universal levels
are boxed: 120 [3] = costs 120SP, available at level 3. If there is no boxed
value, then the skill is purchased by different classes at different levels,
and you will find those levels listed under each class. The cost of separate
tiers are shown with " / " in increasing order.

{5} THE CLASSES
---------------

After the class description, I have added an "Endgame setup", which is just my
suggested list of important skills. This is personal preference of course, as
there is no 'perfect' skill setup. Keep in mind that this is for the late game,
so previously useful skills such as Truestrike, Fortify, Sidestep, Jump, etc.
are not mentioned, while they may actually serve you well at your particular 
point in the game. Not all setups have 10 skills listed, as many classes have
room for extra skills, like recruitment, or a second magic element + augment.
Skill priority is also situational. Skills like Spell Ward and Steadfast
would be more important in areas with many enemy spellcasters and bottomless 
pits, such as the San Bronsa Floating Ruins. Depending on the strength of your
unit's stats, skills and equipment endgame, even the HP boost from Constitution
and bonus damage to humans with Anatomy may be redundant, but I gave them both
high priority just in case. In fact I rarely equip Anatomy or Constitution
anymore, but I can't be certain that other players will have allies with high
enough base stats to make the extra damage & defense unnecessary.

To improve the overview, the "-ology", "Augment", "Resist", "Attenuate" and
"-proof" type skills will not be listed below, as they are universal to all
except Lord. At the bottom are Other skills, listed with their cost in SP and
level at which they can be purchased. Example: "Mighty Impact 120 [3]" means
it costs 120 SP and is available at level 3.

When trying to find a certain class, use ctrl + F key. This will allow you to 
type your search easily, instead of searching through all the information.
Using the class name with asterisk (*) will make it easier to find.

P.S.: I am well aware of the irony of the Class FAQ describing Skills and the
Skill FAQ describing classes!


--->	*Warrior*
								{Ranked: 31/44}
=Human, Winged, Lizardman, Lamia, Orc, Skeleton
A basic class. Melee is the weakest offense in the game, so although the class
has useful skills, it is not very popular. Warrior has the widest access to 
melee weapons of any basic class in the game, so I personally kept Warrior at
lowish level (15-25) to take advantage of skill improvement with weak cursed
weapons. My other FAQ, Skill Improvement, discusses this in detail. Fun fact:
A Whip, Double Impact & Knockback allows Warriors to push enemies back 2 tiles.
A good selection of weapons and melee enhancing skills. Mighty Impact is a very
useful early game skill, giving 100% hit chance, avoids enemy counterattacks,
forces a critical hit and subsequent knockback effect if applicable. Double
Impact speaks for itself, but comes much later and lacks those bonuses. Many
players will be impressed by stronger weapon drops in the early game, causing
them to resort to a Warrior to make use of them. When starting over, I found
that a mix of Archers, Knights, Clerics and Vartan was highly effective.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Constitution IV, Strengthen IV, Counterattack IV, Deflect, Mighty Impact, 
Double Impact.

--->	*Archer*
								{Ranked: 05/44}
=Human, Winged, Lamia, Orc, Skeleton
Like a Warrior, only it has ranged skills instead, which makes a big 
difference. Archers are overpowered early on because they are the first generic
class that has access to 2-handed Bows, which are powerful, and lob the arrow
in an arc rather than a straight line, which avoids the many obstacles in urban
battles early on. Bows can also fire beyond the specified range, especially if 
firing from a high position. Terrain becomes more elevated in later chapters, 
though, and a Bow Archer on low terrain gets a range penalty. They are later 
eclipsed by mages and other classes that can attack more than 1 unit per turn.
Tremendous Shot is their best skill, as it also applies outside the specified 
range for bows. Few people use Crossbow with an Archer, but Double Shot allows
you to kill 2 opponents in a row with clever positioning and targeting. Ranged
combat is in general very efficient, gaining accuracy from the high AGI & DEX
of Archers, meaning their bows will have more accuracy than any bow in the real
world could attain. Their low miss chances are compounded by a +60 damage bonus
(see About Weapons) that all ranged weapons get, and the ease of attacking from
range, which means you can stand still instead of wasting time running towards
the enemy. Taking aim in real life takes more time than a melee attack, and an
arrow usually inflicts less damage than a melee hit, not more. In conclusion:
all the overpowered ranged weapons suffer from a lack of realism in this game.

Endgame setup: Bows/Crossbows, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Constitution IV, Strengthen IV, Counterattack III, Spell Ward II, Tremendous 
Shot, Double Shot.

--->	*Wizard*/*Enchantress*
								{Ranked: 21/44}
=Human, Winged, Lamia, Orc, Skeleton, Ghost
The first mage class available. Mages start off weak, but gain power towards 
the end of the game. It's worth keeping one in your party until another mage 
class is available. Their Meditate skill is important to transfer to others.
The Engulf skill increases *range* by 3, not *area*, despite its description.
Special mage classes still tend to perform better despite a lack of Engulf,
because their movement allowance and speed are often better. If you are
deciding which element to choose for your first Wizard, I'd go with fire,
because Fire Magic offers supporting (de)buffs which are a great help for
your physical attackers at a time when your mage is not strong enough to deal
much damage, and you must rely on your melee and ranged attacks. But most
elements have good support spells, with the exception of ice and water, unless
you enjoy water's Quench, which removes poison and heals a little.

Endgame setup: [elemental] Magic, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Meditate, Constitution III, Spellcraft IV, Spell Ward IV, Engulf [free slot].

--->	*Cleric*
								{Ranked: 29/44}
=Human, Winged
People complain about healing being too weak in the game, but early on you 
will need a lot of it. Clerics heal best, and are like mages against Undead,
since healing damages them. They are the first class with Exorcise, making them
essential unless you cast from scrolls (800goth each). They have no access to
Meditate skill, and even the A.I. compensates by using a Magic Leaf when battle
begins. Expand Mind and Chanelling serve as a good alternative MP supply.
Later on there are classes and items which offer alternative exorcism methods 
which render this class completely obsolete, like the craftable Staff of 
Purification which has 3 castings of Exorcise. Many players choose to abandon
Cleric even earlier, getting by with casting from Exorcise scrolls instead.
Banish scrolls from Palace of the Dead shops are 300 goth cheaper, in fact.
Lobbing bombs and using Cudgels are the Cleric's only realistic weapons, and
many players have fun with a Lobber and Field Alchemy equipped. I found that
Cudgels can in fact be tremendously effective once they reach rank 4, because
there is a light element, damage scaling, double hitting finisher. The rank 8
version is even triple hit; in theory the most powerful finisher in the game!

Endgame setup: Cudgels, Divine Magic, Augment Light, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Constitution III, Spellcraft IV, Expand Mind IV, Chanelling IV,
Mother's Blessing.

--->	*Rune Fencer*/*Valkyrie*
								{Ranked: 08/44}
=Human, Winged, Orc
A very versatile class early on, if a bit weak in combat. They can heal and 
speed up your allies, making them a bit like a cleric. Later in the game, 
their Conserve MP skill allows them to cast powerful magic often, which will
include the multi-hit summons like Wisplight. HP Infusion is a downright
cheesy way to heal a lot of damage, so although Valkyries don't really impress
until they have access to summons and Conserve MP, they are at least good at 
casting Boon of Swiftness, and other supporting magic from frontline or rear.
They will be able to cast Heal IV (60MP) more often than any other class in the
game, in addition to other magic with high MP cost, like Ease debuff & tier II
summons, but they must first get the scrolls from San Bronsa, of course. From a
practical viewpoint, I don't reccommend using this class early on. It gains its
power from mid-game skills, so level it up swiftly later on. If deciding which
class to use, Knight serves you better early on than RF/Valkyrie.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Divine Magic, Augment Light, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I,
Spellcfraft IV, Constitution III, HP Infusion, Conserve MP [free slot].

--->	*Knight*
								{Ranked: 24/44}
=Human, Skeleton (Undead cannot use any Divine Magic spells)
Initially I underestimated the worth of this class, because I had avoided it in
the early chapters of my first playthrough. It has a good selection of weapons
for a starting class, including Crossbows and the high damage Hammers, which I
opted to equip in both hands, allowing for good melee and a weakish ranged
option. Their combat versatility combinied with healing makes them the 2nd best
class to bring with you from the start. It's also a great class for Denam to be
in, in case he has need of Phalanx during duels. Though truthfully, I never
used Phalanx in my 2nd playthrough, but my gaming experience may have mattered.
I had previously claimed that Knights were avoided as targets, but in fact they
do get targeted due to their low DEF value, which was in fact lower than that
of my (well-equipped & with Fortify) Archers, Clerics and Mage. It seems their
toughness stems from extra hit points rather than high DEF value. As for them
being slow: It's not an issue early on. They have 4 base move, so it's easy for
Knights to stay in front of slower classes, while casters can't even climb 2
points of elevation difference. An excellent starting class; it will enable you
to get well-ranked weapon skills quickly, such as 1H Swords (rank 2: Rending
Gale hits x2), Crossbows (rank 2: Brimstone Hail area-effect is considered the
best finisher in the game) and Hammers (high ATT values; great vs. monsters).
Avoid using a shield, as this raised DEF and causes allies to be targeted
instead. Finally, the Phalanx exploit deserves to be mentioned: Some players

will unequip all armour, to drastically lower the Knight's DEF value, drawing
attacks from anyone in range like a magnet. With Phalanx active, 90% of the
damage is mitigated, but enemy A.I. doesn't take this into account. This is an
extremely gamey exploit that will spoil your enjoyment if overused, so beware.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Divine Magic, Augment Light, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I,
Constitution IV, Strengthen IV, Rampart Aura IV, Phalanx, Guardian Force.

--->	*Terror Knight*
								{Ranked: 35/44}
=Human, Orc, Skeleton
This class has access to Dark Magic debuffs, and can inflict Fear on multiple
units, which weakens both attack and defense (although finishers are 
unaffected). It is the slowest class by weight, though, which means they fall
behind in combat a little. Their access to Drain-type spells gives them the
ability to steal enemies' HP, MP or TP. The strength of these spells remains
limited until you have acquired the full Ogre set in postgame, which gives a
great boost to magic damage. The Dark Headsman and Ogre Blade are their best
weapon options, despite the poor performance of 2-handed Swords on most
classes. The Dark Headsman offers +2 to the Lament of the Dead skill rank,
significantly raising success chances. Fear is a powerful debuff, weakening
all attack and defense. They are one of the few classes able to equip the full
Ogre set (Armor, Shield, Helm & Blade), and the full Dark armour set (Thanatos
Armor, Skull Helm & Dagda's Hammer).

Endgame setup: 2H Swords, Dark Magic, Augment Darkness, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I,

--->	*Berserker*
								{Ranked: 32/44}
=Human, Lizardman, Orc
This class is even more melee-oriented than a Warrior, and this is reflected by
its focus on melee weapons. Its skills are also a bit better than a Warrior's.
In practice, they are somewhat slow, but a solid melee choice early on. They 
might not be as tough as you'd expect, though. They take damage, so be careful.
Defenses will improve late game, so a strong unit in this class is fun to play.
They're one of the few classes able to equip the full Dark armour set (Thanatos
Armor, Skull Helm & Dagda's Hammer). Risk Management is a form of defensive
boost; it can be useful, but requires a sturdy ally nearby, and I never made
much use of the skill due to it limiting my frontline-charging allies from
moving apart. Berserk is great fun for wreaking havoc on the enemy, but
Sanguine Assault becomes more effective once you have decent STR to make it
powerful.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Constitution IV, Strengthen IV, Counterattack IV, Berserk, Risk Management, 
Sanguine Assault.

--->	*Swordmaster*
								{Ranked: 44/44}
=Human
This is perhaps the poorest class in the game. 1 weapon option, limited skills
and weak in defense. Their magic offers access to unique buffs and debuffs, 
but a Swordmaster will be a liability in the early game. Preempt is their main
attraction, and coupled with Knockback skill it will prevent a lot of enemy 
melee damage. But this only protects against melee attacks, so mages and
Archers are still a big threat to them. Also take into consideration that 
Wardances have a TP requirement too, and you'll find there is a TP shortage.
The scroll for the wardance Demonpetal Dance, which charms enemies, can only
be acquired before level 26, so make sure you get hold of one or two.
I reccommend getting hold of Tactician from another class for them, or you may
opt to forgo Wardances altogether, to make more room in your skill slots.
Steer clear of monsters and obstacles; any situation that prevents Knockback.
They are the only class that can cast Wardances, and the only class other than
Lord that can use 2-handed Katanas. This uniqueness doesn't balance things out,
but you may end up using one much later, when you are so powerful that class
power almost irrelevant, and you just like it for the gameplay flavour.

Endgame setup: Katanas (2H), Augment [element], Wardances, Swiftfoot I, 
Anatomy, Spellstrike IV, Knockback IV, Strengthen IV, Tactician II, Preempt.

--->	*Dragoon*
								{Ranked: 23/44}
=Human
Specialized in dispatching Dragon and Beast units, they are a popular 
alternative to a 2nd Archer, because they can use all Crossbows, and the
slaying skills apply to ranged attacks as well. Archers hit a wall when 
Monsters requiring high attack start appearing en masse in later chapters;
this is explained in About Weapons chapter, with a link to more details.
Dragoon has an answer for every tough monster except Golems. Equipping 3
items of Wyrmscale-type gear will grant any class the Dragonslayer skill
in combat, so if you do decide to use a Dragoon, Beastslayer has priority.
The "-bane" versions become available later on, offering the same slayer
skills to a group of nearby allies. They will not become more practical
than the basic skills until your Dragoon can easily generate the extra TP.
Most battles only have a few monsters, but there are monster-heavy ones.
As for Spears, they can be fun for attacking two opponents at opportune
moments, but when you need to target a specific monster with your slayer-
boosted attack, Spears often create more obstacles due to allies being in
the way, or the terrain elevation difference being too large. The higher
level Spears have a range of 2-3, which even leads to slapstick pie-in-
the-face situations where you only hit an ally when trying to counter an
enemy attack. Long story short: Dragoon is better with Crossbow than Spear.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Strengthen IV, Counterattack IV, Constitution IV, Beastbane, Dragonsbane,

--->	*Ninja*/*Kunoichi*
								{Ranked: 04/44}
=Human
The strongest generic melee class by far. 1-handed katanas are very powerful, 
and being able to attack with 2 at once is literally overkill. They move fast,
scale elevation with ease due to increased climbing ability, and have powerful
Ninjutsu for ranged damage and (de)buffing. The damage spells are like smaller
versions of the overpowered summon spells, requiring only some components to
cast. Nijutsu has no MP requirement; not even a TP requirement like Wardances
does. There are even ranged finishers if you can't be bothered with Ninjutsu.
This class seems to have been deliberately made too powerful, so use Ninjas at
the risk of spoiling your challenge. Steelstance will reduce damage by 50%, so
it may be worth a skill slot, to increase survivability on the frontline. The
Decoy scroll allows a Ninja to completely negate a single physical attack, but
the scroll only drops before a certain level, so be sure to get some copies.
Ninja also has access to the Cursed Bow, making it the only class besides 
Archer and Ranger with access to a 2-handed Bow. My endgame setup deliberately
omits Double Attack, because endgame units already do enough damage to OHKO.
Blowguns can make damage spells, and Spellcraft, unnecessary. Alternatively
you could still use Double Attack for OHKO-ing the toughest monsters, but then
I'd reccommend also replacing Counterattack II with Spellcraft III skill, so 
you have Ninjutsu attacks that are stronger than the 1H Katana finishers.

Endgame setup: Katanas (1H), Blowguns, Ninjutsu, Augment [element], Anatomy,
Swiftfoot II, Strengthen IV, Counterattack II, Constitution III, Steelstance.

--->	*Rogue*
								{Ranked: 07/44}
=Human, Fairy, Imp/Gremlin
This is the most useful generic class in the game, excelling in speed, damage
output, utility and versatility all at the same time. They are a frail class,
making melee dangerous at the start, but that doesn't make the class balanced.
Ability to Steal from enemies opens up a whole new resource of rare items and
classmarks. Their Sneak Attack and Sparagmos abilities are powerful, but most
of all they are one of the fastest units in the game, because their cost of 
movement is so low: Only 3RT/square, compared to the 4 or 5 of most classes. 
Speedstar makes them even faster, allowing them to haste themselves. They have
access to 4 Familiar skills, but only Fairies and Imps/gremlins can switch to
that class - a lot of effort is needed to give a Human those skills. Agonal
Scream and Lingering Kiss are worth the effort, though. The Reaver Ring is a 
non-unique item that is ideal for a Rogue, giving +2 Steal, and allowing them 
to cast 3x Boon of Swiftness on others. Since you need rank 3 Steal to steal 
the item from a Grim Reaper in Scenic Knoll, Phorampa Wildwoods, this is a 
tedious but rewarding task. Since Sneak attack only works with melee, Fists
and Daggers are their best weapon options. But a ranged Rogue would have room
for other skills, like Counterattack III, Lingering Kiss or Agonal Scream.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill (melee), Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot II,
Strengthen IV, Constitution III, Steal, Sneak Attack, Sparagmos, Speedstar.

--->	*Fusilier*
								{Ranked: 30/44}
=Human
A class that specializes in Fusils. Classmarks are hard to acquire, and the 
Fusils skill can only be learned after level 15 and needs Crossbows skill 
first. Personally I prefer to scavenge generic Fusiliers for their skill.
They are the only class that can use 1-handed and 2-handed fusils. The
selection of Daggers and Crossbows is good as well, but their TP skills will 
only work with Fusils. Only the cursed fusil is elemental, so all but 1 unit 
is limited in damage as a Fusilier. Course Correction allows a Fusilier to
reproduce much of the obstacle avoidance of Bow Archers, although it won't
avoid solid walls and hills. Plants and units will be safely avoided, though.
Fusilier knockbacks work differently, and you may even see a 2nd unit damaged.
Compared to the other classes that can use fusils, Fusilier is very slow. They
also cannot match the power of an Archer, so most players write the class off
as a late game disappointment. They are weak against magic, but have high VIT.
I recommend snapping a Light elemental cursed Fusil, for finisher synergy. You
could even equip an augment, if you even need more damage at that point.

Endgame setup: Fusils, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, Stengthen III, Counterattack II,
Spell Ward II, Constitution III, Knockback I, Sharpshoot, Course Correction.

--->	*Beast Tamer*
								{Ranked: 40/44}
=Human, Winged
Beast Tamers are specialized in augmenting attacks of beasts and dragons.
Beasts and dragons can't use equipment besides jewelry, they have no weapon 
skills, and only their special attacks are elemental. Monster units perform
poorly later on. The Empower skills give a tremendous damage boost, but are 
situational in usage. Blowguns is the Beast Tamer's most reliable option to 
get enough TP for their Empower skill, but they must gain Blowguns skill from
another class. They are the only class that has access to Subdue and Tame, so
it's wise to level up the class to 7, so you can at least purchase the recruit
skills. You will need a lot of dragons to get hold of Deneb.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Strengthen IV, Counterattack III, Constitution IV, Empower Dragon, Empower 
Beast, [free slot].

--->	*Warlock*/*Witch*
								{Ranked: 22/44}
=Human, Lamia, Ghost
The only generic class that can learn Spellbooks and Draconic Magic skills, 
you will be using rare classmarks for units just to acquire them. This class
has TP-skills that are focused on golems. In practice the Warlock/Witch is a
good mage, but barely an upgrade over Wizard/Enchantress. The Empower Golem 
skill is like the corresponding Beast Tamer skills, but it is similarly 
limited in usefulness, with the exception of Pumpkinhead Golem. This class 
needs to take some damage before it has enough TP for an Empower, though. If
using Meditate, you also have a dilemma on your hands. This class can use all
Draconic magic spells, too, but since the stockpile of Wyrm gems can't exceed
99, Draconic Magic can't be used frequently. Remember to learn the elemental
magic skills you need before switching to this class.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, [elemental] Magic, Augment [element], Anatomy,
Swiftfoot I, Spellcraft IV, Constitution III, Meditate, Golem's Bane, 
Empower Golem.

--->	*Necromancer*
								{Ranked: 18/44}
=Human
Unless you get hold of Cressida after her quest in Chaos Path, you will be 
limited to generic recruits of this class. It specializes in boosting the 
Undead & zombies. Necromancy is the only way to heal such units. This is the
fastest mage type in the game by RT, although special classes get more
movement, and movement allowance makes a bigger difference than speed for
mages. In comparison, most other mages are only 3RT slower. Special mage
classes can also do a bit more damage. Improving base stats remedies this.
Remember to learn the elemental magic skills you need before switching to this
class. Necro classmarks are the hardest to get, so don't waste them.
Necromancers are good if you are enthusiastic about having your own undead
army, but in practice such an army is not quite as useful as living allies.
Undead can't be healed normally, Skeletons and Ghosts have very few class 
options, Skeletons actually get +1 RT making them slower, and zombified units
don't gain any XP or SP after battle (but they do drain XP and SP gains).

--->	*Lich*
								{Ranked: 19/44}
=Human {True Uniques and generics only. No Semi-Uniques or Named Generics}
A lich must be created in the Palace of the Dead, and you should look up what
type your unit is in the Scavenging/Recruitment FAQ chapter About units to see
if they are suitable: The Named Generics and Semi-Uniques can't transform into
this, but True Uniques can. A mage must use the Ring of the Dead (found in floor
33) in floor 41 of Palace of the Dead to transform.
A lich is a human class in this game. They have access to a lot of magic types,
including Draconic and Necromancy. The most powerful generic caster class, but
also the slowest. In Lawful and Neutral storylines, Lich is the only way a
unique unit can have access to Necromancy. Besides using scrolls, that is.
Banish and perhaps Zombify are worth casting from scroll.
Despite its slowness, this class is powerful; it has very high casting stats.
Creating one takes time and effort, so you should prepare units that are going
to remain Liches for a long time, to make the effort worthwhile. It pays off to
select a unique unit with a low RT, to mitigate the Lich's slowness.

--->	*Divine Knight*
								{Ranked: 33/44}
=Human (sort of. race is Divine. Can be created from any non-unique humanoid)
A generic-only class, since it must be created from an Undead. It's reportedly
a big disappointment to many, but they have a lot of interesting skills. They 
can use damage spells, but without Spellcraft it is ineffective. Their access
to weaponry is also restricted, but they have a vast amount of TP-skills to
compensate. Most of their skills are best put to use in Palace of the Dead.
Tartaros' Light-element Ambicion sword has innate Leadproof, making it the best
regular weapon for flying Divine Knights. For a chance to get this weapon, you 
must complete CODA4 with only Catiua and Vyce in the party, killing Tartaros 
last. I would summarize DK as a late-game support class. It can later change 
classes as if it were a regular Human, but changing back isn't easy. Generic
humanoids can be zombified, then turned Undead in Palace of the Dead, before it
can use the Ensanguined Rood (San Bronsa floor 1) in SB floor 3. This class can
scavenge skills from regular Humans, too, which is often overlooked, so DK gets
harsher condemnations than it truly deserves. The Scavenging/Recruitment FAQ
has details. The fastest way to get hold of one, is by recruiting a generic
Necromancer. A few are found in the Pirate's Graveyard, and in Palace of the
Dead. After getting a Necromancer, you can learn the Master Undead skill, which
will allow you to recruit Skeletons or Ghosts (Skeletons have higher base
stats). Now you don't need 2 visits to the Palace anymore, and you can go
straight to San Bronsa. The first map of San Bronsa has skeleton Archers with
ranked Bows skill you could pick up.
Being a generic-only melee attacker and wearing heavy armour, this class is
considerably slow, and may become the first recipient for Boon of Swiftness.
DK has a lot of skill choices, so Poignant Melody may be a preference if you 
like to charm oppponents. The ranged weapon is an option I chose, so DK can
gain some TP for those skills. But the Medusa Shield is also a lot of fun
instead; mass petrifying opponents as the first action.

Endgame setup: Swords (1H), Weapon skill (ranged), Augment Light, Anatomy,
Swiftfoot I, Strengthen III, Constitution III, Rampart Aura IV, Requiem,

--->	*Lord*
								{Ranked: 01/44}
=Denam (main character)
Lord can use all weapons besides Instruments and Fusils. All elemental magic 
plus Draconic. He can use skills acquired from other classes, but can't learn
them innately. Mighty Impact, Double Attack, Tremendous Shot and Phalanx can 
be used but not learned. With so many options, this is easily the best class

overall, and you can customize it as you see fit. I suggest the cursed 1-handed
katana, since Ninja can already use cursed 2-handed Bow, and bringing more than
1 Ninja to the late game will get boring fast. The efficiency of Malitza's
Staff for generating the TP Lord needs for spellcasting could be considered
vital: His lack of access to Meditate makes it practical to give him a melee
or hybrid role, unless you decide to equip aforementioned staff for 3x100MP.
Keep in mind that Malitza's Staff can grant 100MP to adjacent allies, so Lord
doesn't have to equip the staff himself to gain the benefits. I believe the 
Familiar class is an excellent sidekick ally to delegate this role to.
Malitza's Staff will allow you to employ magic frequently, without needing
Expand Mind or Chanelling in your 10 precious skill slots.
Additional to what is mentioned already, this class can't learn many standard
skills: the "-ology", Augment and Resist types.
You won't see any need for Phalanx if you have high defense, since enemies 
will target allies anyway. Sadly, Mighty Impact and Tremendous Shot don't 
work with unarmed attacks. Pity, since your main character, with his advanced
stats, will be the first to do powerful damage with punches and rock throws.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, [elemental] Magic, Augment [element], Anatomy,
Swiftfoot II, Spellcraft IV, Counterattack IV, Constitution IV, Strengthen IV,
Tremendous Shot/Mighty Impact.

--->	*Ranger*
								{Ranked: 09/44}
=Vyce, Azelstan
This class is very physically capable, having earlier access to many skills.
Many people debate about whether 2-handed bows or Double Attack is most
worthwhile, but the full set of Ji'ygla's Bow, Bracers and Darkcoat gives the
bow option the final advantage. Since the full Ji'ygla set offers such a big
ranged attack bonus, the Archer's skills boosting damage become unnecessary,
making the Ranger better with the set because it has more movement allowance.
It can be argued that part of the Archer's power is in its ability to stand
still in between shooting, speeding up its next turn. In practice, Ranger with
a bow will do this too, but also has a lot more control over the battlefield,
usually able to reach distant enemies. Even more if he can find higher ground.
Besides the Ji'ygla set and 2-handed Fusils access, this class plays roughly 
like a Ninja with a wider weapon selection, but less useful TP-skills. Earlier
on, his Double Attack will be his most interesting and useful feature, though
keep in mind that swinging 2 Axes or 1-handed Swords will slow down his next
turn a lot more than Daggers.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot II, 
Strengthen IV, Counterattack IV, Constitution IV, Spell Ward II, Overpower,
[free slot].

--->	*Priest*
								{Ranked: 14/44}
=Catiua
She starts out as this class, and is a useful ally early on. Some people prefer
this more than her other classes. Be sure to learn Holy Water, as one of those
other classes can use it. When Catiua is still a guest, any skills you purchase
on her will not be retained by her once you finally recruit her. The same
applies to Vyce. Priest has access to Spiritsurge, which is cheaper in MP cost
than indirect magic, but can only hit 1 target. The ability to Greater Heal
gives the class an advantage, but she lacks Mother's Blessing of the Cleric,
which would have doubled healing. Since the Missile magic is cheap in MP cost,
it's rarely a problem that she can't Meditate. Like the Cleric, Expand Mind and
Chanelling are advised for exorcising. And also like the Cleric, Cudgels are
her only practical weapon option, and her light-elemental synergy is excellent.

Endgame setup: Cudgels, Divine Magic, Augment Light, Anatomy, Swiftfoot I, 
Spellcraft IV, Constitution IV, Expand Mind IV, Channeling IV, Holy Water.

--->	*Princess*
								{Ranked: 06/44}
=Catiua
The Princess is limited to light type body armour, which bars her from using
robes to improve her casting. But she can still use a Wizard's Hat, which is
without doubt the strongest equip for casters, though unbefitting her title.
Most feel that this is Catiua's 'ultimate' class, having access to a great 
deal of physical skills, spells and weaponry. Healing is only single-target,
and magic damage is only indirect, which makes her use more MP. Fortunately,
Meditate and the Priest skill Holy Water can be used as well. Lucky Star is 
the only way to reliably raise the Luck score of your units, although daily 
variations in Luck will lower your value within a few days. Using it often 
in battle will keep your units' luck from fading. If you do decide to use this
skill, keep in mind that allies who often use Double Shot, Double Impact or
Double Attack will actually experience more 'unlucky' knockbacks with high
Luck. Access to Draconic Magic must be acquired from elsewhere, but Princess
doesn't really have need of any. Heavenly Judge, the undead-exorcising Divine
Magic Apocrypha spell, is the main attraction, and Princess is the best
equipped to use it, of the few classes that can (Lord, Astromancer & Princess).

--->	*Dark Priest*
								{Ranked: 17/44}
=Catiua
This is her weakest unique class, and classmarks for this are only found one
at a time in story battles in the Hanging Gardens. If you want more than 2 
of these classmarks, you will need to unlock world mode. This class can't use
Divine Magic, but allows for a unique selection of Dark Magic spells to be 
cast (Paradigm Shift most notably absent). Some people enjoy using Drain Heart
in battle, and the class really gives Catiua a whole new feel, in both gameplay
options and appearance. Her best weapon option is Spellbooks, which must be 
learned elsewhere. Non-Dark elements are available, but intentionally limited.
Dark Priest can use Meditate if acquired, but cannot use Holy Water, of course.

--->	*Paladin*
								{Ranked: 26/44}
=Lanselot
This is the last unit you can acquire in the postgame (CODA). Although he 
fights for you in chapter 1, you can only experience the class properly if you
can get him yourself. It is definitely an improvement on the basic Knight; it
has access to a much wider range of weapons, and much more utility magic. Too
bad it comes so very late, as it would have been a great mid-game class.
Paladin can get Light-Touched with Consecrate Edge as a skill move, allowing
it to still attack in the same turn. But it can't cast Instill on others.
Lanselot is a popular scavenge point for the hard-to-acquire skills Parry,
Overpower, Swords (1H) and Augment Light, all at rank 4. many people like to
scavenge him many times over to acquire his skills for their regular units
before recruiting him for real. The Anchor Point in CODA allows him to be
recruited in 2 battles.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Divine Magic, Anatomy, 
Swiftfoot I, Strengthen IV, Counterattack IV, Constitution IV, Rampart Aura IV,

--->	*Astromancer*
								{Ranked: 12/44}
=Warren
This class has a curious inability to wear any kind of legwear. Linen Slops
are the tightest restraint that this class will accept below the belt. Maybe
letting it all hang loose helps him to commune with the heavens. Sounds like 
a lot of fun, actually. But practically speaking, this bans Warren from using 
the useful mobility footwear: Cloud Shoes, Sidhe Shoes and Winged Boots. Of 
course there are rings of those types too, but mages do much better with the 
high damage boost from Chokers, elemental necklaces from Jewelry III recipe 
book. Astromancer will either have mobility issues and need Wheel of Fortune 
tarot cards, or will have to give up the Choker damage boost. The latter is
more practical in the late game, because Astromancer already has such high INT
& MIND growth. Warren starts off with Augment Dark and Lightning, but it 
pays off to invest in Augment Light instead, since the class has access to 
Heavenly Judge, which deals damage & exorcises. A very strong mage class that 
is worth the effort to get. The Astromancer's only access to debuffing spells
is with Dark Magic, so this may pose a dilemma to you: Divine Magic for the
exorcism effect of Heavenly Judge, or Dark Magic for its utility spells. You
can also consider the Draconic Starfall as an exorcism surrogate, but this
requires that you expend Wyrm Gems for casting, so you must buy them often.
It has some interesting TP skills, but nothing too powerful. Astromancer has
a better chance of generating the TP for a Resonance than Shaman, but the
buff only gives bonus damage to *armed physical attacks*, not magic.

--->	*Vartan*
								{Ranked: 13/44}
=Winged (also Canopus but not Iuria)
This class has as main downside that it's very slow if it moves too far. The
cost in RT per square moved is 6, the single highest cost of any class. If used
primarily as ranged attacker, it can stay still most of the time, and avoid the
penalty. El Colas Winds grants Air-Touched to nearby allies and self, which is
a very valuable damage boost. But Air-Touched will only add damage to armed
physical attacks (melee or ranged, not finishers), so it will be of no use to
monsters, and only helps casters if they decide to whack an enemy with a cudgel
instead of cast a spell, which is only useful for generating TP, and it's
unclear whether Air-Touched will boost TP gains. Canopus should be using Augment
Air from the start, and it doesn't matter if his weapon is air element, because
the damage bonus will still work. Bows access is limited to 1-handed bows, so he
should also make the switch to Crossbows as soon as possible. I favour Canopus
as Buccaneer class over Vartan because I want his melee to be practical, but El
Colas Winds is very tempting. Lack of Spellcraft makes his magic quite useless,
although once he gets strong base stats, at least it does passable damage.
Vartan classmarks appear exclusively in chapter 1 story battles, which may
indicate that it was intended to be a starting class. Canopus' movement range
is pivotal for early game missions, where he can traverse distance and obstacles
immediately, engage the enemy early with melee (counterattacks), and try to take
out Archers and mages in the enemy's rear. But, switching Canopus to another
class for rescue missions may be even better, so he can use a Lobber to more
quickly heal the damsel in distress.

--->	*White Knight*
								{Ranked: 25/44}
=Gildas, Mirdyn, Ravness, Ozma
This class has a powerful ability to speed up allies while still being able to
attack in the same turn. Paralysis Blade is also useful, as it is a quaranteed
stun effect (unless Stunproof), lasts for a few turns, and can affect many
enemies in counterattack too.
This class compares to Knight slightly unfavourably, simply because it comes
too late to be as useful as Knight was, while still a bit early to write off
Phalanx completely. Since you'll be trying out the wider 2-handed weapon
selection, chances are it will take more damage than a Knight with Phalanx and
perhaps a shield. Taking damage does speed up TP accumulation, for which WK has
various uses. It's also quite a slow class, which is further compounded when
using Velocity Shift on allies. WK often falls behind in combat. It has an 
interesting selection of weapons, spells & skills. The class is well-balanced.

--->	*Shaman*
								{Ranked: 02/44}
=Olivya, Sherri, Cistina, Cerya, Deneb, Iuria
This mage deals the most damage by a fair amount. It is the only caster with
access to both the Apocrypha/forbidden spells, and the multi-hit summons.
Besides a Cyclops with Dark Magic, that is.
With Nature's Touch, there is no non-boss in the game that can't be killed in
1 attack by this class. Perhaps even all bosses too. It can use Spellbooks 
and Draconic Magic if it learned the skills from another class, which poses a
limitation to Winged Iuria unless you read my Scavenging/Recruitment FAQ. Since
Shaman represents a 'nature' type mage, it is barred from using Divine and 
Dark Magic schools, although it can still cast Draconic Magic of those 
elements. The Resonance abilities serve Astromancer better. Shaman rarely uses
them, since it's usually more beneficial to Meditate or cast Nature's Touch.
Since it can only use the damaging spells from Draconic magic, the only reason
to equip Draconic Magic, is if you want to use Starfall for exorcism.

--->	*Wicce*
								{Ranked: 11/44}
=Deneb
The most time-consuming recruit to get hold of in the story, she only comes 
with her unique class unlocked if you also sell 30 Glass Pumpkins before you
buy the 45th and last of the orbs (for which you need to auction 3 dragons of 
all 8 elements + 3 Hydras in order to be able to buy them. tip: any auctioned
Dragon besides Hydra makes 2 of its classmarks purchasable). Many people, 
like myself, repeatedly fought the 1st map of Palace of the Dead for the 
Glass Pumpkins. You really must unlock her Wicce class when you get Deneb, 
because her shop will be run by Punkin afterwards, and this remains even if 
you travel back in time with world mode in postgame. You can only do her quest
again if you dismiss her, which wastes all the investment in her base stats.
This class can use Magic time!, which grants Spellcraft and Spellstrike buffs
without losing your action turn. Since the useful Spellcraft buff can also be
gifted from The Hermit tarot card, or even area-effect with Ardent Conga 
(the scroll can be bought for 200goth in postgame, so I stocked up on 99),
I had my doubts about this class. But after using it, I must admit that 
it helps if you don't lose your attack action to get Spellcraft. Deneb also 
has a default ranged attack called Rail Against instead of Throw Rock, which 
is magical in nature, allowing her to attack an opponent to amass needed TP.
Access to Whips and Counterattack I also helps in terms of TP accumulation,
and this gives her class a unique playstyle. Classmarks cost 5000 goth each!

--->	*Songstress*
								{Ranked: 36/44}
=Iuria, Pumpkinhead Golem
The Songstress can learn Spellcraft IV, but at first glance has nothing that
actually benefits from it - sort of the opposite of Divine Knight's problem.
As explained under Wicce, Ardent Conga is a powerful ability, but it can easily
be cast from scroll by another class, since the scroll only costs 200goth.
Songstress is a poor support class overall. Weak in defense, and all of the
debuffing songs must be cast at close range. The class isn't very useful, 
but since it is the only class able to use Instruments, it is the only way
to actually use a (cursed) Instrument. A Cursed Instrument is a good way to
reduce damage taken for this frontline support class. Instruments have 2 
finishers with the largest area effect in the game, so taking damage may pay
off occasionally, when you get to use one. All Songs are similar to those 2
finishers, in that they have range 0 area 3. Echoing and Resounding Voice
skill will double song duration and extend song range by 1, respectively, 
but they can't be used together. There are no damaging songs, and it's 
doubtful that Spellcraft actually raises the value of HP & MP buffs.
I personally found Spellcraft to be worthwhile with the Blood Whip for its 3
castings of Drain Heart, and there are some Instruments with castable attack
spells too, though none have the same elements as the powerful finishers.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Songs, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I,

Echoing Voice.

--->	*Buccaneer*
								{Ranked: 10/44}
=Azelstan, Vyce, Canopus, Denam/main character
Double Attack, Speedstar, and 1-handed Fusils. This class is a very versatile
frontliner. Better than the generic Ninja, since Daggers are the lightest
weapons in the game, and deal very good damage (some exceptions are explained
in the About Weapons chapter). Canopus has the lowest RT of the 4 characters
that can use the class, but has no ability to learn Fusils or Double Attack
from Winged classes, so read my Scavenging/Recruitment FAQ for information.
Competing with Ranger, many people favour Rangers for their ability to use
2-handed bows, in particular the Ji'ygla's Bow, which has a huge damage 
bonus if equipped with the full set of Bracers and Darkcoat. Buccaneer is a
very capable melee class, with some ranged options. Early on, they will be
as powerful with Double Attack as the Ninja, Lord, Ranger and Knight Commander
are, and will even be faster with Speedstar. Later on, Double Attack will be
less appealing, since most enemies won't survive a single Dagger attack. Then
it's more fun to combine melee and ranged. Although 1-handed Fusils have only
medium range, Fusil finishers go as far as range 9. Evade and Speedstar skills
have poor synergy: When the Nullify buff from Evade is in effect, Speedstar
will remove Nullify instead of adding Quickened status. I'd just avoid Evade.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, 2nd Weapon skill/Double Attack, Augment [element],
Anatomy, Swiftfoot II, Counterattack IV, Strengthen IV, Constitution IV,
Speedstar, [free slot].

--->	*Knight Commander*
								{Ranked: 03/44}
=Ozma
The speedy Knight Commander class can potentially eclipse Lord in a melee role.
A precursor to the Lord class, this class can use a variety of weapons and
magic. It has good melee skills, but Double Attack and Mighty Impact are
usually mutually exclusive, because the critical from Mighty Impact causes
knockback on the first strike, putting the enemy out of range for the second
attack. It can be combined when an enemy is immune to knockback, like Monsters
and units with Steadfast equipped, or even when terrain holds them in place. HP
Infusion is the only other skill worth mentioning, but it is better on Rune
Fencers/Valkyries, because Ozma is so tough that she'll rarely need it, if
ever. The other skills she can use are not bad either, but with only 10 skill
slots to use, they will rarely be chosen. Popular equipment choices include
double Daggers or 1-handed Swords, and her starting weapon, Whip. She has a
special Whip finisher available only to her. In the late game, I prefer to
equip the Ogre set on her, which means Ogre Armor, Helm, and either the Shield
+ 1-handed weapon, or the 2-handed Sword Ogre Blade. Weapon damage becomes so
high that Double Attack becomes unnecessary endgame.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, [elemental] Magic, Augment [element], Anatomy,

--->	*Hoplite*
								{Ranked: 37/44}
=Lizardman, Lamia, Orc
This is intended to be the humanoid-only version of a defensive tank, which is
reflected by the skills it can use. It is a very sturdy class, which means 
enemy Lizardman Hoplites, with their higher average STR, VIT, and as a result,
high DEF, remain the most difficult humanoid to kill in battle in the endgame.
The skills Evade and Apostate give extra protection against physical and magic
attacks, respectively. Apostate is probably the best for enemies to use, since
your own mages will become very powerful, but enemy AI always seems to use
Evade instead. But the Decoy buff makes it even harder to bring down a sturdy
enemy Hoplite without magic. An ally will make better use of Evade; because
enemy mages are weak. Their weapon selection is uninspiring, with the exception
of Spears and Hammers. They're one of the few classes able to equip the full
Ogre set (Armor, Helm & Shield), and the full Dark armour set (Thanatos Armor,
Skull Helm & Dagda's Hammer).

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, Augment [element], Anatomy, Swiftfoot I,
Rampart Aura IV, Counterattack III, Strengthen IV, Constitution IV, Evade,
Rapier Glance.

--->	*Juggernaut*
								{Ranked: 28/44}
=Lizardman, Lamia, Orc
Their skills are debuffs (Frightened, Bound) and buff removers (remove
readied skills), making them similar in gameplay to a Terror Knight. With 10
RT less than a TK, this class can achieve what the TK was supposed to. They
can wreak havoc on the frontlines, and significantly weaken enemies.
This is intended to be the non-human version of an offensive tank, and they 
have a high movement allowance to reflect this, but sadly no access to 
Swiftfoot II. Like the Hoplite, their most exciting weapon option is Spear
for its reach and multi-hit potential, but it has other good weapon choices.
Their 5 movement and swimming allows them to reach the frontline early, and 
the reach of Spears gives them enough range to be similar to Ninja in speed.
They're one of the few classes able to equip the full Ogre set (Armor, Helm &
Blade), and the full Dark armour set (Thanatos Armor, Skull Helm & Dagda's 
Hammer). Their skills are focused on offense, but unfortunately they are all 
ranked skills, meaning it would take ages to improve them. High base stats
make even rank 1 skills very successful, though.

--->	*Patriarch*/*Matriarch*
								{Ranked: 16/44}
=Lizardman, Lamia, Orc
This is a humanoid-only casting class. It can use all Daggers and Light type 
armour, and Counteratack I makes its melee a decent option in combat. It has
defensive skills like Ivory Tower and Intercession, which are more useful on
this fragile caster than they were on sturdy Ozma. But they will need to make
use of their Daggers to get enough TP for those defensive skills. It is one of
very few classes with ability to cast the multi-hit summon spells, and can
innately learn Meditate. Irresistible Beauty is nothing but a novelty, since
the unrecruitable Gorgon units have the Evil Eye effect that makes it useful.
Once you've crafted a Gorgon Shield, though, you'd have a petrifying 2-man
combo. Like the other non-human classes Hoplite and Juggernaut, this class has
innate ability to Swim, which makes it similar to magic-melee hybrids like 
RF/Valkyie & Knight Commander. But in practice, this is predominantly a caster
class, and the light armours don't boost its INT or MIND much, unfortunately.

--->	*Familiar*
								{Ranked: 15/44}
=Fairy, Imp/Gremlin, Pumpkinhead Golem
This interesting class has the largest selection of skills of any class, some
of which can be transferred to Rogues. They have 3 pairs of Kiss-type abilities
each with the same names: One of each pair can be used by Rogue, the other
can't. They work best casting Divine Magic, because that gives them access to
Heal and Boon of Swiftness. Pumpkinhead Golems that get an Empower effect from
a Warlock/Witch will have an enormous damage boost to their physical attacks,
which includes damaging TP skills, but not finishers or magic. New recruits of
any race will start out frail; as easy to kill as enemy Familiars are. But they
have access to Constitution IV and Fortify IV, and combined with stat boosts
from frequent use, they'll become tough enough.
Although Divine and Dark magic offer the class the best utility, only the 6
other elements have access to Instill type spells. They can equip Light type 
armour, all Daggers, Blowguns and some physical skills, making them somewhat
similar to Rogues in playstyle. With so many TP skills available, you will
not be able to equip all of them, so each Familiar setup will be different.
Nearly all Familiars you encounter in battle will be floating, but this is
tied to the unit's race, and is not innate to the Familiar class. Familiars
of any race cannot use Jump skill, so this is a good reason to equip a
mobility item (Winged or Sidhe Boots/Ring) on a Pumpkinhead especially.
Zombie is my personal favourite setup. A Zombie Pumpkinhead using the suicidal 
Pumpkin Bomb skill to blow up its surrounding enemies in a blaze of fire. 
Combine with an Empower Golem from Warlock/Witch, and nothing will survive the
explosion. A Necromancer with Animate Dead would also allow the zombie to 
stand up right after the explosion. It does count as incapacitation, though.
My Familiar also equips Malitza's Staff, to grant 100MP to my Lord in battle.

Endgame setup: Weapon skill, [elemental] Magic, Augment [element], Anatomy,

--->	*Cloud, *Earth, *Thunder, *Flood, *Flame and *Frost *Dragon*
						   {Flame/Frost Ranked: 39/44}
							{Others Ranked: 41/44}
=Dragon
This is a Monster class, which means it has no access to weapons, and can only
use accessories but no other equipment. It cannot use consumables either. All
monster races have a base of 55 Recovery Time on top of their class RT; 5 more
than generic humanoid races. Despite this, most monsters are quite fast, since
they will have almost no encumbrance from equipment. Their basic attacks are
unarmed and without weapon skill. Monsters are immune to Knockback effects from
humanoids but not from other monsters, and have no access to mobility skills.
Dragons have an elemental affiliation, which determines their special breath 
attacks and Resonance skills. Besides this, they are very similar in playstyle,
with the exception of Flood and Flame Dragons, which get innate Swim and 
Lavawalk, respectively. And the Earth Dragon can actually walk on Earth! Yay.
It should be mentioned that the elemental damage boost from Resonance is only
applied to ARMED physical attacks, not to unarmed monster attacks, not to TP
skills, finishers, or magic. So, only adjacent humanoids can benefit from it.

Endgame setup: Augment [element], Anatomy, Rampart Aura III, Counterattack IV,
Strengthen IV, Truestrike IV, Constitution IV, [elemental] Breath II, Dash,
[elemental] Resonance.

Hydra is different from other Dragons, in that it cannot change classes with a
classmark. There are no Hydra classmarks, and it doesn't belong to the same
scavenging group. They have no elemental affinity, and get access to many
skills at a later level than other Dragons. Their main attraction appears to be
a higher base damage on their physical attacks (as well as earlier Truestrike
access), but their lack of Rampart Aura or Resonance skill makes them even less
useful on the front line later on. At least they can learn Tactician.

Golems have nearly identical skill access, but some TP skills, Rampart Aura and
Reflect Magic skills are available at different levels. Their class represents
the material they are composed of, and this affects their vulnerability to
physical and magic damage. Golems have no use for elemental augments at all.
Their Broaden Force skill will raise the level of the Rampart Aura the golem
has equipped, even beyond tier IV! Rampart Aura V will grind enemy movements 
in battle to a complete halt. They are the only Monsters without access to 
Constitution, but Gordian Lock is like the Phalanx skill with bonus TP growth!

--->	*Gryphon*
								{Ranked: 27/44}
=Beast. No classmarks.
This is a Monster class, which means it has no access to weapons, and can only
use accessories but no other equipment. It cannot use consumables either. All
monster races have a base of 55 Recovery Time on top of their class RT; 5 more
than generic humanoid races. Despite this, most monsters are quite fast, since
they will have almost no encumbrance from equipment. Their basic attacks are
unarmed and without weapon skill. Monsters are immune to Knockback effects from
humanoids but not from other monsters, and have no access to mobility skills.
Due to their limitations, I'm not a fan of using Monsters, but Gryphon is the
most popular Monster type, because of its useful TP skills and innate flight.
Blood Siphon allows the Gryphon to steal enemies' HP, making it very durable.
Although their accuracy is low, their boulder attacks can make them decent
ranged attackers, especially because they can easily fly to high ground. Obda
the Younger and Berda the Younger are Ganpp's pet Gryphons, which can be 
recruited with him. They have better starting stats and RT. Many thanks to
EcclesiaXI for passing on detailed info for this class's TP skills. Although
breath attacks are dark elemental, their Blood Siphon has no element. They
gain most from Augment Air for Wind Shot, which affects a larger area.

Endgame setup: Augment Air, Anatomy, Counterattack III, Strengthen II, 
Truestrike IV, Constitution IV, Dash, Blood Siphon, Wind Shot, [free slot].

Another flying Monster, with the exact same standard skill overview as the 
Gryphon. Unfortunately, its TP skills are less useful than its counterpart's.
Although their accuracy is low, their boulder attacks can make them decent
ranged attackers, especially because they can easily fly to high ground. Many 
thanks to EcclesiaXI for passing on detailed info for this class's TP skills.
Since Wind Shot is out of the picture, Augment Darkness will improve their TP
skills, of which the petrifying Petro Breath is unique to them. Just remember
that petrifying an opponent is very effective to disable them for a while, but
it also makes them tougher to kill. There will be occasions where Stun Breath
will be more practical, so it's useful to equip both skills.

--->	*Octopus*
								{Ranked: 42/44}
=Beast. No classmarks.
This is a Monster class, which means it has no access to weapons, and can only

monster races have a base of 55 Recovery Time on top of their class RT; 5 more

unarmed and without weapon skill. Monsters are immune to Knockback effects from
humanoids but not from other monsters, and have no access to mobility skills.
The Octopus has TP abilities that are only usable when it is standing on a 
water tile, or has cast the Aquaveil skill. I wouldn't advise casting it before
the end of a turn if you have Counterattack equipped, because any attack will 
remove the Aquaveil. It is very useful on terrain with a lot of water, but is 
more restricted on dry land. Its area-effect skills can do devastating damage 
to a lot of opponents. Many thanks to EcclesiaXI for passing on detailed info
for this class's TP skills. All the damage skills have water element, so it
goes without saying that Augment Water is mandatory on an Octopus.

--->	*Cyclops*
								{Ranked: 20/44}
=Beast. No classmarks.
This is a Monster class, which means it has no access to weapons, and can only
use accessories but no other equipment. It CAN use *basic* consumables, but
items that require Field Alchemy can never be used by the Cyclops directly. 
All monster races have a base of 55 Recovery Time on top of their class RT; 5 
more than generic humanoid races. Despite this, most monsters are quite fast; 
they will have almost no encumbrance from equipment. Their basic attacks are
unarmed and without weapon skill. Monsters are immune to Knockback effects from
humanoids but not from other monsters, and have no access to mobility skills.
Cyclopes can cast any spell from scroll, and their access to basic consumables
puts them halfway between Monsters and Humanoids in terms of usefulness. They 
will be weak casters when compared with fully equipped humanoid mages, but 
their *complete* access to Dark Magic spells gives them great appeal. They have
much faster casting animations in game, so they will be quick casters in both 
gameplay and turn order. Cyclopes' access to Salamander and Wendigo summons is 
the only occurrence in game of a class having varying spell access to the 6 
natural elements. Dark Magic serves them best, but all their TP skills are non-
elemental. So, if you don't care about access to the utility spells, or the
high-MP-cost Abyss apocrypha, you are free to choose the element you prefer.
Cyclopes can be set up in different ways, with more emphasis on TP skills, or
instead sacrificing physical skills for Expand Mind and Chanelling, which is
necessary if you intend to cast high-MP magic, like the summons or Abyss.

{6} SKILL DESCRIPTIONS
----------------------

--- Standard Skills:
Most class-unique skills are already described and evaluated in the Class FAQ.
www.gamefaqs.com/psp/999440-tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together/faqs/62169
However, non-human skills and standard skills are noticeably missing from it.
I will attempt to rectify this.
Standard skills are often usable by all classes, but there are many that can't
be used by certain classes, and some can be used but not learned by a class.
Standard skills are basically all non-TP using skills. Standard skills are 
listed above class skills in the in-game skill list.

- AIR MAGIC: A popular magic type, with useful debuffs that inflict Sleep and
  Bound status.
- EARTH MAGIC: A good magic type, with useful debuffs that inflict Slowed and
  Petrified status, as well as Fortify buff.
- LIGHTNING MAGIC: A good magic type, with useful debuffs that can reset RT, 
  and inflict Stunned and Shackled status.
- WATER MAGIC: This magic type has less useful debuffs, like Hobbled, Poisoned
  and Misstep, although it has a buff that can heal a little and remove poison.
- FIRE MAGIC: A popular magic type, which can inflict Breached, Weakened, 
  reset TP, and has a useful Strengthen buff, many supporting melee and ranged.
- ICE MAGIC: Seen as the worst magic type, it has highly situational (de)buffs
  including Spellstrike, Battering Ram, Spellslip and Leadened.
- DIVINE MAGIC: Only 1 class has full access to all Divine spells, but it
  consists of many important spells, including healing, exorcism, Boon of
  Swiftness, and almost all debuff-removing spells. Undead can equip the skill,
  but are barred from using any of the spells.
- DARK MAGIC: Only 2 classes have full access to all Dark spells, but many mage 
  classes have almost complete access. It consists of many important spells,
  including Drain-type, Paradigm Shift and almost every possible debuffing 
  effect in the game. Undead are immune to dark damage, except Drain-type magic
  and Hellhound summon.
- DRACONIC MAGIC: Its scrolls are hard to acquire, but it offers powerful damage
  and utility spells. Its main downside is that these spells all cost Wyrm Gems,
  of which you can only stockpile 99 at a time. Starfall will exorcise undead.
- NECROMANCY: Rare magic reserved for the Lich and Necromancer classes. They
  need components for casting, but since there are a number of different ones, 

  Necromancy is more sustainable than Draconic Magic. Its magic is involved with
  the undead, and also inflicts unique debuffs that even Dark Magic lacks access
  to, such as Bewitch, Curse, Wither and Addle.
- NINJUTSU: Special magic for Ninjas, which require a variety of components for
  casting. The lack of any MP requirement makes these spells as overpowered as 
  the rest of the Ninja abilities. A good selection of (de)buffs and damagers.
- WARDANCES: Swordmaster's special magic is less effective than Ninjas. It uses
  more expensive fans as components, has a TP requirement per spell (but no MP
  requirement), and the selection of spells is a novelty at best, comprising of
  utility spells only. Spellstrike is recommended to improve success rates.
- SONGS: The worst magic type in the game. They rely on a vulnerable Songstress
  to cast close-range area-effect (de)buffs. Only the Ardent Conga scroll is 
  useful, but can simply be cast by any class from scroll for just 200goth.
  Songs use Songstress Scores, and are much cheaper than other magic components,
  but can only be bought in special shops and found as treasure in San Bronsa.

- FISTS: A good melee weapon with a ranged finisher.
- DAGGERS: The most overpowered melee weapon, which gets +80 bonus damage and is
  also very lightweight. Has a ranged and a double-hit finisher. Keep daggers
  upgraded, because due to their low weapon ATT values, it's easy to lose the 
  bonus damage.
- SWORDS (1H): Popular in the early game, and the rank 2 double-hit finisher can
  be very helpful. It is outclassed by other melee later on. +12 bonus damage.
- SWORDS (2H): A poor weapon choice, heavy with unimpressive finishers. Its only
  commendable aspect, is that dark elemental ones work well for Terror Knight.
- AXES: A poor weapon choice, heavy with unimpressive finishers (1 double-hits).
- SPEARS: A weapon with ability to hit 2 enemies at once, a triple-strike and an
  area finisher. Its only drawback is that it can be more difficult to hit 
  opponents with the higher level range 2-3 type spears, due to elevation and
  positioning issues. Allies risk getting caught in counterattacks, too.
- HAMMERS: Popular due to the many classes that can use it, it has many weapons
  with high damage, and a ranged area finisher. But they're a bit heavy. Hammers
  have the highest weapon ATT values, so they work well against tough monsters.
- KATANAS (1H): Powerful weapons that can be dual-wielded to attack twice. Only
  available to Ninja and Lord classes. Has a non-ranged area effect, 2 ranged,
  and a double-hit finisher. They share the +80 bonus damage of daggers. Though
  they are a bit heavier, their higher ATT puts them at less risk of losing the
  damage bonus than daggers. Still, keep 1H katanas upgraded nonetheless.
- KATANAS (2H): The exclusive weapon of the disappointing Swordmaster class, but
  can be used by Lord. The weapon type is passable, with a petrifying finisher.
- CUDGELS: The only weapon in the game with a triple-hit elemental finisher. All
  finishers are Light element, and this offers Cleric some melee possibilities
  with their only weapon option. Their main purpose is to enhance casting power.
  The multi-hit finishers are also damage-scaling to TP spent, so very powerful.
- WHIPS: An interesting weapon, with ranged finishers and a double-hitter. Ozma
  gets a unique finisher, the Ice elemental Demon Rose, which can charm enemies.
  Most whips have range 1-2, but unlike spears, they will only damage the
  closest unit, not both. There is a unique 1-handed whip in CODA4, with range1.
- SPELLBOOKS: A rare weapon, the chance you will use its finishers often is low:
  It can only be used by a few caster classes, and is meant to augment casting.
  It has a double-hit finisher.
- INSTRUMENTS: Only available to Songstress, it has 2 range1 area3 finishers
  which can hurt a large group of opponents, damage-scaling to TP, with Air and
  Water elements. The rank 2 finisher is also a double-hitter. This is the
  Songstress's main redeeming quality.
- BLOWGUNS: This ranged weapon can only be used by select classes. Its range is
  more limited than other ranged weapons, but they are very useful for status
  effects which they can inflict, and the only 1-handed elemental ranged weapons
  in the game are Blowguns. They work well with any class that can use them.
  All ranged weapons get +60 bonus damage, but Blowguns have a limited selection
  and low ATT, so without bonus damage, they appear quite weak in the beginning.
  Once you get stronger, and acquire better blowguns, damage will skyrocket.
- BOWS: The most overpowered weapon in the early game, which makes the Archer 
  the most useful class at the start. They can often fire beyond the specified
  range, and elevation will also give a bonus (or penalty) to range. The Bow 
  finishers have a variety of debuffs: Leaden, Sleep, Charm and Shackle. The 
  ability to lob the arrow allows many obstacles to be ignored, but when enemies
  are on higher terrain, bows are at a disadvantage. +60 bonus damage adds to
  their strength, though some players hit a wall when they rely too heavily on
  Archers in their team, and their outdated bows become ineffective against high
  level monsters. Keep bows updated to avoid this.
- CROSSBOWS: This ranged weapon is better at shooting uphill than the bow, and 
  the rank 2 finisher Brimstone Hail ignores obstacles and is very powerful.
  There is also a triple-hit finisher. More classes have access to 2-handed
  Crossbows than 2-handed Bows, and all elemental (Cross)Bows are 2-handers.
  Since crossbows are widely usable, switching to Rogue or Dragoon is a popular
  alternative to crossbow Archers. You can only lose the +60 bonus damage if you
  are careless, as mentioned above.
- FUSILS: A novelty ranged weapon. Lack of elements make all but the cursed 
  fusil limited in power, although the high base damage slightly mitigates this.
  They have great range and finishers, but are less powerful than (Cross)Bows.
  The damage-scaling double-hitting finisher appears at rank 6. Fusil weapon
  selection is limited, but due to their high ATT, you're unlikely to lose the
  +60 bonus damage unless you're very unlucky with fusil drops in game. Deflect
  doesn't work against Fusils.
- THROWN: This weapon type seems to have been designed to give the enemy a
  high-damage basic attack, but curiously this weapon has no finishers. Since
  the projectiles are lost once thrown, it is extremely expensive to replenish.
  It's uncertain if they get the +60 bonus damage of other ranged weapons, but
  their damage output is high enough to assume that they do.

- SHIELDS: This is not a skill. I list availability of shields for each class
  below the weapon skills to improve the overview. Some classes are described
  as having access to Small type shields, which include Buckler, Pelta, Aspis,
  Spiked and Baldur Shield. Beast Tamer has a somewhat opposite selection which
  I called Large type. All classes except Swordmaster can use Buckler and 
  Baldur Shield. Shields are useful for their guaranteed knockback effect, as
  well as a variety of other bonuses they offer when equipped.
- BODY ARMOUR: This is not a skill. I list availability of body armour for each
  class below the weapon skills to improve the overview. The three types I name
  are Robes, Light and Heavy type gear. In fact, the early body armours are
  freely equippable by both Heavy and Light type users. The distinction only
  becomes relevant once elemental body armour is available. Most of the strong
  defensive gear are body armour, so this is why it is an important gear type.
- OTHER ARMOUR: This is not a skill. As a final overview of equipment, I give my
  general impression of other equipment availability. This is highly subjective.

- ANATOMY: A basic damage boost against all human opponents, healing bonuses
  for clerics, easier recruiting of Winged and humans. A must-have skill, due
  to the predominant presence of human opponents in the game.
- TERATOLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Beast opponents, etc.
- HERPETOLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Reptile opponents, etc.
- DRACONOLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Dragon opponents, etc.
- SACROLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Divine opponents, etc.
- DAEMONOLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Umbra opponents, etc.
- AUROLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Fairy opponents, etc.
- THANATOLOGY: A basic damage boost against all Phantom opponents, etc.
- GOLEMY: A basic damage boost against all Golem opponents, etc.
- AUGMENT AIR: A basic damage & defensive boost for Air elemental attacks.
  Its works well together with Rogue, Vartan, and Gryphon. It has very nice
  finishers for Dagger, Instrument and Fusil.
- AUGMENT EARTH: A basic damage & defensive boost for Earth elemental attacks.
  Earth weapon selection is decent, but with only 2 disappointing finishers.
- AUGMENT LIGHTNING: A basic damage boost for & vs. Lightning elemental attacks.
  There are quite a lot of great lightning weapons, as well as strong finishers.
- AUGMENT WATER: A basic damage & defensive boost for Water elemental attacks.
  It also boosts Quench healing slightly for the caster, but if the target also
  has this skill equipped, healing actually gets reduced slightly. Water weapon
  selection gets a bit short-changed, because it's the only element *without* a
  bow or crossbow that has 3 castings of the Instill spell, instead getting one
  short-range dragon's breath-type attack. But Whip has a great water finisher.
  A cursed water whip is a great weapon for Deneb. The stat bonuses will give
  any mage awesome power, and Wicce is the only mage that can equip it.
- AUGMENT FIRE: A basic damage & defensive boost for Fire elemental attacks.
  Hammers and Crossbows do well with this augment, because they have ranged,
  area-effect fire finishers that can dish out a lot of damage.
- AUGMENT ICE: A basic damage & defensive boost for Ice elemental attacks. The
  weapon seletion is average at best; the most noteworthy Ice weapon is the
  spear with Dragonslayer skill, if equipped with 2 other Wyrmscale gear.
  Dragonslayer skill is useful on a Hoplite or Juggernaut, who can use spears.
- AUGMENT LIGHT: A basic damage boost for Light elemental attacks. Protects
  against Dark damage, but not against Light. It also boosts healing slightly
  for the caster. Light element weaponry gets an innate boost when fighting the
  undead (a light element cursed weapon doesn't get this bonus), making it a
  very good element to choose. Especially when you consider the tremendous
  utility of Divine Magic, as well as healing and exorcism. It has good synergy
  with Cleric types, Knight types, and Valkyries.
- AUGMENT DARK: A basic damage & defensive boost for Dark elemental attacks.
  Protects against Dark damage, but not against Light. Dark weapons are among
  the most powerful in the game, but most augmenting dark armors and equipment
  are unique, with the exception of Shadowed Greaves (which compete with the
  mobility footwear). The best element for many mages, and Terror Knight.

- PARRY: After the Dodge/Block chance is handled, Parry skill allows for a 
  second chance to avoid any physical melee attack. Be advised that this skill
  only applies for units with a melee weapon equipped. Shields don't count.
  A melee and a ranged weapon is also a working combo. Parrying will reportedly
  grant only half the regular skill improvement to any of the relevant skills;
  this is from Badposter's observation after being parried & ranking up swords:
  www.gamefaqs.com/boards/999440-tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together/68333908
- DEFLECT: After the Sidestep/Block chance is handled, Deflect skill allows
  for a second chance to avoid any physical ranged attack besides Fusils. Be 
  advised that this skill only applies for units with a melee weapon equipped.
  Shields don't count. A melee and a ranged weapon is also a working combo.
  Deflecting (or being deflected for that matter) will reportedly grant only
  half the regular skill improvement to any of the relevant skills.
- OVERPOWER: If an enemy successfully parries or deflects your melee or ranged
  attack, Overpower allows yet another chance to nullify this. Overpower will
  be active and improve even if you don't have a melee weapon equipped, but it
  requires Parry as a prerequisite to be able to learn the skill.

- RESIST PETRIFY: A situational boost to your resist chance against petrifying.
- RESIST STUN: A situational boost to your resist chance against stunning.
- RESIST SLEEP: A situational boost to your resist chance against sleep.
- RESIST CHARM: A situational boost to your resist chance against charm.
- RESIST POISON: A situational boost to your resist chance against poisoning.
- RESIST SILENCE: A situational boost to your resist chance against silencing.
- RESIST SLOW: A situational boost to your resist chance against slowing.
- RESIST BIND: A situational boost to your resist chance against binding.
- RESIST SHACKLE: A situational boost to your resist chance against shackling.
- RESIST STOP: A situational boost to your resist chance against stopping.
- RESIST LEADEN: A situational boost to your resist chance against leadening.
- RESIST FEAR: A situational boost to your resist chance against fear effect.
- RESIST VENOM: A situational boost to your resist chance against venom effect.
- RESIST CURSE: A situational boost to your resist chance against curses.
  All of these Resist-type skills are a poor use of a skill slot. I advise
  using Spell Ward skill instead, for a decent protection against all statuses
  of magical origin.

- ATTENUATE AIR: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Air damage.
- ATTENUATE EARTH: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Earth damage.
- ATTENUATE LIGHTNING: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Lightning
  damage.
- ATTENUATE WATER: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Water damage.
- ATTENUATE FIRE: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Fire damage.
- ATTENUATE ICE: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Ice damage.
- ATTENUATE LIGHT: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Light damage.
  Unlike the others, this type may be very useful for Zombie & Phantom units,
  which are innately vulnerable to light-elemental damage.*
- ATTENUATE DARK: Depending on your augment rank, this reduces Dark damage.
 * Since I recently discovered that Dark resistance actually protects against
   Light damage but not against Dark (the opposite is true for Light
   resistance), I'm unsure whether Attenuate Light or Dark is the one that
   helps protect undead.

- RAMPART AURA I-IV: This skill stops any units from advancing past the aura.
  Only flying units are immune, and those with the Siege skill or Battering
  Ram buff. Floating and teleporting units are affected by it, but the aura
  is not effective if the square's elevation is 4 higher or lower.
- COUNTERATTACK I-IV: A very good skill, that allows you to attack during an
  opponent's turn, which costs you no movement time whatsoever. A free attack
  may sound amazing, but beware of killing opponents you may want to chariot,
  or ending battle prematurely when you want to pick up bags/cards. It also
  carries some risk if you give opponents the TP needed for skills/finishers.
  In short: very helpful, but the lack of control is an issue. Lawful units
  seem not to counter attacks from *allies*, in case that matters to you.
- KNOCKBACK I-IV: This skill is situational, as it doesn't boost damage. It
  can prevent counterattacks, and a Swordmaster with Preempt can even prevent
  the initial attack. Some like using this to knock people over cliffs, but 
  shields have this effect already. It can help to clear passage sometimes.
- STRENGTHEN I-IV: This skill will offer a damage boost to most opponents,
  and it is fairly reliable. However, there are situations where it has been
  observed that Strengthen will do no further damage, like with a very high
  attack, or a unit that allows for no further bonus damage. But these
  situations are very rare. Read the link below (under Fortify) for details.
- FORTIFY I-IV: Like Strengthen, this skill often has little or no effect if
  defending against 'strong', higher level opponents. Some people don't like
  using Fortify on many classes, because reduced damage means less TP buildup
  for finishers and skills. All defense skills are helpful in the early game,
  but Fortify loses its usefulness quickly as your units become tougher:
  www.gamefaqs.com/boards/999440-tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together/66623108
- SPELLCRAFT I-IV: This is a basic damage enhancer to any magic damage. It is
  absolutely essential for any class that wants to do damage with spells.
  However, there are situations where it has been observed that Spellcraft will
  do no further damage, like with a very high magic attack, or a unit that
  allows for no further bonus damage. But these situations are very rare. Read
  the link above (under Fortify) for details.
- RESISTANCE I-IV: This reduces magic damage taken. Enemy magic damage is
  very poor after the early game, so you don't have to bother with this.
- TRUESTRIKE I-IV: This raises melee hit rate success. Early and mid-game
  units might need it, and it can be very helpful for Skill Improvement in 
  A.I. mode (read the Skill Improvement FAQ).
- TRUEFLIGHT I-IV: This raises ranged hit rate success. It shouldn't be
  necessary for most ranged units later on, since they will have high DEX.
- SPELLSTRIKE I-IV: This raises the spell success rate. Most magic users will
  be better off trying to improve their INT & MIND stats instead, but there 
  are some hybrid classes, like Terror Knight and Swordmaster, who might still
  benefit from it. Only offensive spells, buff removers and debuffs are affected
  by it; buffs, healing and debuff removers will always be 100% successful.
- DODGE I-IV: This raises melee Block rate success. This success rate is
  capped at 75% from the unit's front, 60% from the sides and 45% from the
  back. Once the AVD stat is high enough to achieve this on its own, Dodge skill
  serves no more purpose. Blocking is handled before Parry skill can take
  effect, so this skill may be detrimental to Parry skill rank improvement.
- SIDESTEP I-IV: This raises ranged Block rate success. This success rate is
  capped at 75% from the unit's front, 60% from the sides and 45% from the
  back. Once the AVD stat is high enough to achieve this on its own, Sidestep
  skill serves no further purpose. Blocking is handled before Deflect skill can
  take effect, so Sidestep may be detrimental to Deflect skill rank improvement.
- SPELL WARD I-IV: This lowers the chances of enemy *spell* success rate. It is
  very useful for protecting against the many debuffing spells that mages try
  to cast on your units. Even the maximum Spell Ward II on most units helps a
  lot. Without this, enemy status effects will hamper and slow you down. It
  has no effect on statuses inflicted by enemy *skills* or *finishers*, though.
- CONSTITUTION I-IV: A flat HP bonus, increasing your survivability. Since HP
  will lengthen your health bar, they protect against all kinds of damage. It
  is highly advisable to use this skill on all units, unless they are already
  very tough. It is also considered to be a superior defense over the other
  defense skill Fortify, because taking damage better facilitates TP buildup.
  Fortify becomes ineffective very fast, while Constitution remains useful.
- INSIGHT I-IV: This raises the maximum of stored MP, but this should rarely
  be an issue, if ever. If you ever reach the maximum MP, then you probably
  don't need so many Magic Points anyway.
- EXPAND MIND I-IV: This speeds up MP regeneration. Normal regeneration 
  occurs at +2MP every 18RT, and each tier of Expand Mind shortens the time
  it takes by -2, up to +2MP/10RT for tier IV.
- CHANNELING I-IV: This skill lowers the actual MP cost of spells by 5, 10,
  15 and 20%, respectively. Note that it doesn't allow you to cast spells 
  earlier: If a spell costs 30MP to cast normally, a unit with Chanelling IV
  must already have 30MP avalable in order to cast it for only 24MP. Expand 
  Mind and Chanelling together will be as effective as a high-ranked Meditate
  and this is best for units without access to Meditate - even a bit faster.
  But skill slots are important, so you'll prefer to use Meditate if you can.

- STONEPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Petrified. Resist Petrify needed.
- STUNPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Stunned. Resist Stun needed.
- SLEEPPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Asleep. Resist Sleep needed.
- CHARMPROOF: Immunity to the status effects Charmed and Bewitched. Resist
  Charm needed.
- FOOLPROOF: Immunity to the status effects Paranoia and Spendthrift. Resist
  Sleep needed.
- POISONPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Poisoned. Resist Poison needed.
- SILENCEPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Silenced. Resist Silence needed.
- SLOWPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Slowed. Resist Slow needed.
- STOPPROOF: Immunity to the status effects Bound, Shackled and Stopped.
  Resist Stop needed.
- LEADPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Leadened. Resist Leaden needed.
- FEARPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Frightened. Resist Fear needed.
- VENOMPROOF: Immunity to the status effect Envenomed. Resist Venom needed.
- CURSEPROOF: Immunity to the status effects Withered, Addled and Cursed. 
  Resist Curse needed.
  All of these "proof"-type skills are a poor use of a skill slot. I advise
  using Spell Ward skill instead, for a good protection against all statuses.
  Some players still favour a few of these, despite their huge SP cost.

- RECOVERY TIME:  This is not a skill. I list basic RT of each class, because
  this has a great effect on the speed, and resulting performance in battle.
  Base class RT varies from 20 to 38.
- RT/MOVE: This is not a skill. I list the cost in RT of movement per tile.
  Speedy or slow movement can change the overall effectivity of units. The most
  striking examples are the Vartan's 6RT/tile, making melee combat very slow,
  and the Rogue's 3RT/tile which gives it a lot of mobility.
- MOVE: This is not a skill. I list basic movement allowance to improve the
  overview. Movement is of vital importance and can be increased with Swiftfoot
  skill. Jump and Wade can also be helpful on certain terrains. the terms Slow,
  Agile and Fly refer to terrain climbing of 1up 2down, 2up 3down*, and 32up 
  32down, respectively. *The Ninja class is an exception, with 3up 4down. Some 
  races have Float ability (2up 4down), but this is not tied to any class. Any
  unit that floats gains a melee attack advantage, able to attack 3up 3down
  instead of the regular 2up 3down. If a class is able to Swim innately, this 
  is mentioned here too, with "+Swim".

- SWIFTFOOT I-II: Movement is essenial in this game, and extra travel distance
  will raise the effectiveness of every unit. This is one of the most important
  skills in the game, and every unit should equip it.
- JUMP I-II: Terrain on maps can often be very steep and unfavourable. Using
  this skill will facilitate a unit's mobility a great deal. It becomes less
  relevant once you have acquired a number of mobility boosting items, such as
  Cloud/Sidhe/Winged Boots and Rings.
- WADE I-II: Being able to traverse water tiles can be helpful, but it is far
  less useful than the mobility boosts of Swiftfoot and Jump. Several classes
  also get this innately. The second rank reduces the movement cost from 2 to 1
  per square. Picking up drops from water tiles can be necessary at times, but
  Cloud Shoes/Boots and The World tarot cards can do the same thing.
- SANCTUARY I-II: An interesting skill, but highly situational. It keeps all
  Phantom and Zombie opponents from entering the unit's vicinity. This serves
  as a protection from melee against them, but since ranged and magic attacks
  also come into play, this skill is far from a complete defense.
- STEADFAST: This protects units from being knocked back, which can be useful
  in areas with many bottomless cliffs. A unit knocked off a cliff will be
  removed from combat and lose a heart immediately. The San Bronsa ruins are 
  especially troublesome in this regard. Although the more fragile classes do
  not get access to Steadfast, they can still be protected by mobility bonuses
  like Fly or Blinkwalk from Boots, Rings or the Wheel of Fortune tarot card.
- FIELD ALCHEMY I-IV: Some people love this skill, because it offers access to
  a wide range of powerful consumables, good for healing, attacking and casting
  many sorts of (de)buffs & removers. Many of these consumables are expensive,
  though, and cost time and crafting components. It should also be noted that
  scrolls can always be used without Field Alchemy in this game, and some of
  them are just as affordable as consumables. People in the early game will
  mostly be using Field Alchemy for healing, but this should become redundant
  later on, when your units gain powerful stats, skills, items and levels.
- LOBBER: This is not a skill. I list availability of lobbers for each class
  below Field Alchemy to improve the overview, because some players rely on
  Lobbers and Field Alchemy a lot. Lobber +0, +1 and +2 have ranges 3-5, 4-7
  and 5-9 respectively. If the class has access to the basic Lobber +0, then 
  the description will read "Lobber: +0". "Lobber: --" means no access at all.
- MAX TP I-IV: This skill does to your TP bar what Constitution and Insight do
  to your HP and MP bars, respectively. It can be useful for classes that can 
  amass large amounts of TP from combat, and unleash finishers with *damage*
  scaling. This means, if a finisher says: "Damage is modified by TP." in the
  description, like the Bow's rank 4 Slumber Shot finisher, then it will do 
  a lot more damage when a 300TP Slumber Shot is fired than a 100TP version.
  However, if the description says "Accuracy is modified by TP.", then it's
  best to fire the finisher when you just have 100TP. In fact, most damage-
  scaling finishers do less damage at 100TP than accuracy-scaling ones.
- TACTICIAN I-II: Each tier of this skill reduces the refresh time of TP
  accumulation by 3RT. The normal accumulation is 2TP/18RT, but with tier II
  you will gain 2TP/12RT. Useful for earlier access to TP-using skills and
  finishers, but not essential. Much more TP is gained from physical attacks.
- REFLECT DAMAGE I-II: This returns 10-20% of physical damage dealt back to
  the attacker, but you still get 100% damage. I personally dislike the skill,
  because it has the same potential to backfire as Counterattack does (with TP 
  buildup on the enemy, risk of killing opponents you want to steal from or
  chariot, ending battle prematurely, etc.), but it has far less potential to
  offer an advandage in killing opponents than Counterattack does.
- REFLECT MAGIC I-II: The magic damage version of Reflect Damage. This skill is
  largely useless, because very few magic casters can do significant damage to
  any well-equipped party. If an opponent attacks for 1 point of magic damage, 
  you can see 0 damage being reflected. A gimmicky waste of a skill slot.
- ABSORB MP I-II: I'm not sure if casters actively avoid mages with this skill
  equipped, but even if they don't, they will usually target non-casters simply
  because they have lower magic resistance. Another waste of a skill slot.
- MEDITATE: Although this is not a standard skill, it is cross-class useable
  by so many mage classes, that it might as well be. The MP bonus of a rank 1
  Meditate casting starts off low, at around 5MP per use, but once you get a
  few ranks in this skill, you will see higher rewards. Rank 8 with a Wizard's
  Hat +1 and Sorcerer's Robe +1 (together a +4 Meditate bonus) will net you MP
  well over 60 points! Alternatives to Meditate are using powerful Magic Leaf
  consumables with Field Alchemy, and equipping Expand Mind IV and Channeling 
  IV together. Those 2 skills will raise more MP than Meditate can, and also
  won't slow down the unit or take up their skill action. But they do use 2
  skill slots, so you will often prefer Meditate, because those 10 skill slots
  are a major limitation in the game. Meditate allows for faster MP access in
  the first rounds, which is another advantage over Expand Mind & Channeling.
- DOUBLE ATTACK: This skill is standard type (uses no TP), but only 5 classes
  in the game can use it. It is very important to many melee builds, and the
  few classes that can use it must learn it from the Ninja or Ranger class.
  Being able to attack twice is a very powerful ability, and it also doesn't
  cost a skill action or TP, unlike Double Strike or Double Shot. The only
  drawback is if you get a knockback on the first attack. Technically, you
  don't want to have high Luck with Double Attack, to avoid critical hits and
  the resulting knockback effect. Attacking twice delays your next turn a bit.
- TRAJECTORY: This is helpful early game, to see a glowing line along the
  trajectory of any projectile you wish to launch. Later on, it should be easy
  enough to judge for yourself whether the path is blocked, so you should
  practice your own estimation skill to free up a slot. Rotating the screen can
  be helpful (Top Left Button + Left/Right). And if not, there is always
  charioting. This skill doesn't work for Missile-type magic or finishers.
- TREASURE HUNT I-II: The different tiers of this skill open up different loot 
  tables when you land on treasure squares. The treasure is usually better with
  this skill, but not always. I recently found rare humanoid classmarks with an
  *unlucky* unit without any Treasure Hunt skill in San Bronsa, while those 
  same treasure sites held less interesting golem and dragon classmarks with 
  the skill. Luck, as an aside, changes from day to day and can be modified by
  equipping items that grant luck bonus or penalty. It can be viewed from the
  unit's Condition screen, by pressing Select and moving the cursor to the unit
  portrait there. 4 or less stars is unlucky, 7+ is definitely lucky. Don't be
  worried if your units pick up a negative luck tarot card; its effects will
  dissipate. Bad luck may even be desirable if you want to avoid knockbacks.


--- Non-Human Skills:
Humanoid skills that have already been described in the Class FAQ are shared 
with one or two human classes. These are Squash, Evade, Apostate, Intimidate,
Ivory Tower, Intercession, Coax and Meditate. Monster skills shared with human
classes are Aerial, Telluric, Charged, Aquatic, Blazing, Icy, Luminant & Shady
Resonance, and Rampart Shadow. Resonance skills are mentioned below, because
they were overlooked in the Class FAQ. All undescribed skills are found below:

- SILENT SONG (Divine Knight): A medium-range attack that unleashes a hushed
  hymn sung in the divine tongue upon multiple targets. Has a chance to
  Silence. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area3
- POIGNANT MELODY (Divine Knight): A medium-range ability that unleashes a
  heartrending hymn sung in the divine tongue upon multiple targets. Has a
  chance to Charm. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area3
- EVILSBANE (Divine Knight): Increase the melee damage dealt to umbra units by
  friendly units within 2 tiles. TP=70, RT=+24, range1 area3
- REQUIEM (Divine Knight): A medium-range attack that deals heavy Light damage
  on multiple undead units with a rueful requiem sung in the divine tongue.
  TP=50ALL, RT=+20, range1 area3
- DAY OF RECKONING (Divine Knight): A medium-range ability that unleashes a
  boisterous ballad sung in the divine tongue upon multiple targets. Has a
  chance to reset MP and TP. TP=50ALL, RT=+20, range1 area3
- CELESTIAL SONG (Divine Knight): A medium-range ability that unleashes a
  rapturous hymn sung in the divine tongue upon multiple targets. Has a chance
  to remove the ZOMBIE condition. TP=50ALL, RT=+20, range1 area3
- RAPIER GLANCE (Hoplite): ShackleE enemy units within 1 tile. Chance of success
  increases with rank. Many ranked skills with a success percentage against 
  opponents are of limited usefulness, unless you decide to dedicate a lot of
  time with a unit in that class, or you have progressed so much in stats that 
  rank 1 always achieves 100% success. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area2.
- THREATEN (Juggernaut): Silence enemy units within 1 tile and reduce their MP
  by 25% of maximum. Chance of success increases with rank. TP=50, RT=+20, 
  range1 area2.
- CHECK (Juggernaut): BIND enemy units within 1 tile. Chance of success
  increases with rank. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area2.
- IRRESITIBLE BEAUTY (P/Matriarch): Force all enemy units to turn in your
  direction. Chance of success increases with rank. TP=30, RT=+16, whole map.
- GLUTTONY (P/Matriarch, Familiar): Consume a Jack 'o Lantern to restore some
  MP. TP=25, RT=+15, range1-3 area1.
- PUMPKIN LURE (Familiar): Act as a decoy. Effect fades when struck by physical
  attacks or magic. Basically, it nullifies 1 single attack, physical or
  magical, which is quite useful. TP=40, RT=+18, range1 area1.
- PUMPKIN BOMB (Familiar): A suicidal medium range attack that deals heavy
  Piercing Fire damage over a wide area. The user is *always* incapacitated,
  and surrounding area damage is handled separate. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area4.
- PUMPKIN PIE: A long-range ability that calls forth a deluge of HP-restoring
  pumpkin pies from the heavens. No element; restores about 20-40 HP. TP=50ALL,
  RT=+20, range5 area3.
- PUMPKIN STRIKE: A long-range attack that deals Crushing Dark damage to
  multiple targets by dropping a giant festering pumpkin on them. Has a chance
  to Leaden. TP=50ALL, RT=+20, range5 area2.
- CRYSTAL PUMPKIN (Familiar): A long-range attack that deals Crushing Light
  damage to a single target by striking them with a crystalline pumpkin filled
  with divine light. Has a chance to destroy undead units. TP=100ALL, RT=+30, 
  range2-5 area1.
- AGONAL SCREAM (Familiar): A short-range attack that unleashes a scream of 
  pure anguish upon multiple targets. Has a chance to Frighten. This is not a
  ranked skill, like Lament of the Dead, but it does use up the action instead
  of the skill move, so you can't attack in the same turn. Useable by Rogue!
  TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area3.
- VIRTUOUS DANCE (Familiar): A medium-range attack that entrances multiple
  targets with a seductive dance. Has a chance to Charm and Bewitch. TP=50,
  RT=+20, range1 area3.
- Jack-'o-Lantern (Familiar): Place a Jack-'o-Lantern that serves as an
  obstacle. TP=50, RT=+20, range1 area1.
- LINGERING KISS (Familiar): A medium-range ability that plants a passionate
  kiss on a single target, splitting the caster's HP with them and reducing
  their RT to 0, allowing them to act immediately. In fact, this ability will
  attempt to completely heal the target, even if it drains the Familiar's HP
  to 0, so be careful with it. TP=50, RT=+20, range2 area1.
- LINGERING KISS (Familiar): A medium-range ability that plants a passionate
  kiss on a single target, absorbing HP and resetting RT. Deals Piercing Dark
  damage. Useable by Rogue! TP=50, RT=+20, range2 area1.
- COQUETTISH KISS (Familiar): A medium-range attack consisting of an impish kiss
  blown at a single target. Has a Chance to Charm and Bewitch. TP=50, RT=+20,
  range2 area1.
- COQUETTISH KISS (Familiar): A medium-range attack consisting of an impish kiss

{7} ABOUT WEAPONS
-----------------

--- Weapon ATTACK progression:
The base ATT of a weapon determines its damage output, together with skill and
STR/DEX modifiers. Units that the game classifies as tough (monsters) have an
ATT threshold that must be overcome, otherwise damage is very low. Certain
weapon types have innate bonus damage, which is listed behind each row.
This is a table of weapon availability which I compiled on this thread (pg.2):

STR or DEX bonuses included in weapons were treated as part of the base ATT.
In addition to this information, a host of new discoveries were made in the
thread linked above. In summary:

Piercing, Slashing and Crushing damage types are confirmed to have the same
effects on monster classes; their actual damage boosts are extremely minor.
It appears that a unit's race will only be of relevance if a weapon has a
racial damage bonus. Stats are the only thing that matter: Lizardmen are
tough due to their high STR and VIT, Familiars are frail because of low VIT.
There is some speculation that monsters have an innate defensive bonus,
making weapons below a certain ATT threshold (70-90?) very ineffective.

Since Hammers are the first weapons to break through this threshold with
their high weapon ATT values, crushing damage was mistakenly seen as good
against monsters. It's high weapon base ATT that's good against monsters.
I discuss an alternative explanation for the observations of Crushing &
Piercing effects over the years, and reach the conclusion that there is no
strength or weakness to any damage type in particular. There are only minor
differences in equipment resistance. I believe the misconceptions arose from
varying weapon selections with different ATTACK values, and hidden damage
bonuses in DEX-type weapons. Damage bonuses are lost if your ATT is too low.

When comparing Augment and Anatomy skills for Missile type magic, Augment
seems to offer more damage boost than Anatomy, but tests are not conclusive.
Divine and Dark Magic types seem to behave differently in terms of damage
calculations than the other 6 elements, but it is not clear what or why. I
also observed the phenomenon of Augment Darkness protecting against Divine
Magic! Augment Light protects against Dark Magic. But those Augments do not
offer any protection against damage from their OWN corresponding magic type.

On a sidenote, Choker necklaces from the Jewelry III recipe book are well-known
as the strongest non-unique damage booster, for both physical and magical
attacks. Occasionally the Firecrest outstrips them, but this is a unique item.
It appears to be due to the Choker's innate 40 elemental damage boost, which
gets added to the damage of a weapon or spell of that element. The +1 Augment
is relatively insignificant in comparison to the innate damage bonus. Just a
few points in INT is often enough to outcompete +1 Augment, so improve INT.

--- Finishers
Different units have different stats, making the damage outputs hard to 
compare. Data was collected once units had amassed 200TP. However, finisher
damage seems to be more linked to TP and weapon strength than it it to stats,
though stats do still matter. This is unlike damage from regular attacks,
which advances faster from stat improvement. Keep in mind that elemental and
damage scaling finishers have resources to further increase damage by using
Augment skills and Max TP.

--- Monster TP attacks
All damage skills were tested at ~100TP and later at 200TP. The damage was
exactly the same, though accuracy always increased to 100% at 200TP. It
seems that they all work exactly the same as "accuracy scaling to TP"
finishers. Target: Denam, lvl50 Lord. Effective stats all between 228-240.
All monsters have base stats maxed at 100. Monsters had no items, and no
other skills equipped besides the TP skills themselves. pi=piercing,
sl=slashing, cr=crushing, 1~2=hits 2 squares in a row, range3=range 1-3

CYCLOPS lvl50:
     Sweaty Palms: 175 cr leaden hobble
Reeking Meatballs: 185 cr addle misstep
    Pirate Breath: 205 cr wither spoilheal
      Stinky Feet: 195 cr shackle

GOLEM (Clay) lvl50:
     Cruelest Cut: 224 sl 1~2 stun
     Granite Fist: 214 cr 1~2
    Heaven's Tear: 227 cr range3 area2
        Raven Eye: 204 cr area3

HYDRA lvl50:
    Poison Breath: 189 1~2 poison DARK
 Poison Breath II: 222 range3 area2 poison DARK
        Tail Lash: 209 cr 1~2
     Toxic Breath: 184 1~2 leaden DARK

        Tail Lash: 193 cr 1~2 
     Toxic Breath: 168 1~2 leaden DARK

OCTOPUS lvl50: {skills can only be used in water tiles, or w/Aquaveil readied}
      Aqua Bubble: 182 cr range3-7 WATER
      Blue Spiral: 194 pi 1~2 WATER
      Poison Rain: 177 range5 area3 poison WATER
        Maelstrom: 189 sl area3 WATER

COCKATRICE lvl50:
      Stun Breath: 159 1~2 stun DARK
   Stun Breath II: 192 range3 area2 stun DARK
     Numbing Hook: 174 sl 1~2 STUN
     Petro Breath: 159 1~2 petrify DARK
  Petro Breath II: 192 range3 area2 petrify DARK

GRYPHON lvl50:
        Wind Shot: 175 sl range3 area2 AIR
      Stun Breath: 162 1~2 stun DARK
   Stun Breath II: 195 range3 area2 stun DARK
     Numbing Hook: 177 sl 1~2 stun
     Blood Siphon: 167 sl range2 HP-stealing

You may notice that Toxic Breath I & II give better damage for the Hydra
than for the Flood Dragon. This may be due to Hydra having 2STR & 7DEX over
the Flood Dragon, but more interestingly, the difference between tier I and
II seems to be 33pts damage for both, which may indicate that there is a
fixed damage component to the TP skills. This can of course be augmented
with higher stats, Augments and the like. Original thread:
www.gamefaqs.com/boards/999440-tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together/68342152

--- Humanoid TP attacks
The following results are for skill that aren't technically monster skills, but
they are a TP dmg skill similar to those possessed by monsters mentioned above.
With the exception of Rogue class, the skills only appear on non-human classes.
Non-damaging skills were also equipped on these classes for the test, and those
tested did not gain accuracy with increased TP spent, unlike the damaging TP
skills, which function similarly to monster skills. Keep in mind that the tests
below were performed with NAKED units that had less than 100 base stats, so
don't underestimate the skills just because dmg is lower than the monsters'.

DIVINE KNIGHT lvl50 [naked w/mid-range base stats]:
        Evilsbane: +68-81 dmg bonus vs. Umbra measured (3 allies tested)
          Requiem:  35 dmg LIGHT (vs. enemy Ghost) [affects undead only]
 Day of Reckoning:  ** usually enemies lose ALL moderate amounts of MP & TP.
Silent Song & Poignant Melody: Accuracy doesn't scale to TP

ROGUE lvl50 [naked Lanselot w/very high base stats]:
        Sparagmos:  26 sl AIR (vs naked Lord Denam)
   Lingering Kiss:  24 pi drain DARK (naked Lord Denam) [undead immune]

FAMILIAR lvl50 [naked Pumpkinhead Golem w/low-mid-range base stats]:
      Pumpkin Pie: +40HP healing (affects allies only, always 40HP)
     Pumpkin Bomb:  50 sl suicide FIRE (vs. naked Lord Denam)
  Crystal Pumpkin:  30 cr exorcism LIGHT (vs. Denam)
   Pumpkin Strike:  30 cr leaden DARK (vs. Denam) [undead NOT immune]
   Lingering Kiss:  20 pi drain DARK (vs. Denam) [undead immune]
   Lingering Kiss:  ** available HP given until target healed completely,
		      even if Familiar dies as a result!
     Pumpkin Lure: Works as Decoy buff, but can also prevent a magic attack!
Selfless Kiss, Agonal Scream & Coquettish Kiss: accuracy not scaling to TP

EMPOWER EFFECTS:
This is different, because it must be applied by Beast Tamer or Witch/Warlock
onto a Beast/Dragon or Golem, respectively. The recipients of the readied
skill were the same as the naked lvl50 units tested above: max stats Octopus
and Flood Dragon, and low-mid-range stats Pumpkinhead Golem. They targeted a
naked, high-base-stats Denam with their basic melee attack, *without* and then
*with* Empower buff. Unfortunately, the naked Pumpkinhead was too weak, and an
Empowered attack still did only 1dmg to every target except herself. From this
I can assume that an Empower effect does well over 100 extra points damage to
a beast/dragon/golem attack that is sufficiently powerful on its own, but the
bonus tapers off if the creature has a weak basic attack, to the point that
Empower does 0 extra damage to attacks that do only 1 damage.
    Empower Beast: 250 (without=142)
   Empower Dragon: 256 (without=141)
    Empower Golem: 107 (without=14) [Pumpkinhead targets herself]

-------------------------

--- Scavenging Skills
Some skills cannot be leveled with Skill Improvement. Weapon skills are
also risky to level with trainees, as the finishers might cause a premature
victory. Sometimes it's just better to scavenge. My Scavenging & Recruitment
FAQ is linked below.
-Of particular interest may be: Meditate - Human Enchantress (Rank 4 - The 
Reisan Way)
-From my own experience: The shrines are full of Fusiliers with rank 3
Fusils. This is a hard skill to acquire normally. Fusils skill is only
selectable from Fusiliers at level 15! I scavenged many of them. Chapter 4
may have some rank 4 Fusils, as the story battles in this chapter have many
rank 4 skills, making them the best place to find skills.
-Bortegun Fens, the area before Palace of the Dead, is brimming with units 
that have multiple rank 4 skills each. You can recruit human Warriors (Fist, 
2H sword & Whip), Archers (Bow & Crossbow) and Rogues (Fist & Dagger).
Opponents in chapter 4 story battles also have many rank 4 weapon skills.
-Many Heavenly General battles have Winged, Lamia and Orc Archers with rank 
6 Bow & Crossbow skills. The Winged are in San Bronsa Floating Ruins floor 4.
The Orc and Lamia Archers can be recruited in Palace of the Dead floor 89.

Necromancer classmarks: Drop from 2 Necromancers in floor 18 of Palace of the
Dead, but only if you have recruited Cressida (who also brings 3 classmarks
upon recruitment) in Warren Report. If you go to another route (law/neutral)
the Necromancers in PotD floor 18 will no longer drop classmarks.

Buccaneer classmarks: Only drop if you have Azelstan in Warren Report, alive,
AND present during the battle. 1 mark can be gained in the Pirate's Graveyard
treasure, an Imp rogue in Neimrahava woods can drop it (drops rogue marks 
without Azelstan), and 3 Skeleton Archers in the *Non-story* battle of On
Holy Ground will drop 3 each.

Tier II ninjutsu scrolls: All but 1 are found deep in Palace of the Dead. 
Many also drop in pre-shrine fortress battles. Waveshear II ONLY drops in 
the Quadriga pre-shrine fortress battle. It drops from a Kunoichi.

Tier II Apocrypha: If you faced all the guardians in story battles before 
hitting level 35, only tier I dropped. After level 35, recipe drops are not 
guaranteed, but tier II Apocrypha also become a possibility. I recommend 
saving, reloading and charioting the killing blow until you get it all. Only 
the LAST story guardian you defeat will drop 3 (sometimes 6) Shaman classmarks.
Non-story guardians are very different, and won't drop Apocrypha OR recipes at 
all. Guardians in non-story revisits are not designated targets, and are not 
guaranteed to spawn anymore. They have a chance to drop a Shaman classmark. 
Non-story item drops :
Water- Tlaloc's Bolt (unique spear)
Fire - Fire Gauntlets and Fire Shield
Lightning - Xolotl's Canine (dagger), Wyrm Whisker
Ice - Hoarfrost Greaves (boots), Enchanted Feather
Air - Vainateya's Talons (unique fist), Enchanted Feather
Earth - Nathalork's Mail, Orichalcum
Despite numerous tries, I was never able to get both a crafting component and
an item in the same drop, but classmarks dropped frequently with the rest.

Dark Knight Commanders' Loot: The best place to get these is during CODA 4. 
Read Elyon's CODA guide for details. Ozma can in fact drop 2 unique whips.

The Alluring items are special drops, only accessible in world. They are not 
equipped, but the female only Dress and Highboots will drop from Gousin 
during the story battle at the Golborza Plains, but only when you replay 
this battle in world, not during the first run of the game. Catiua must be 
present, and answer Gousin's question with the 2nd dialogue option. Similarly,
the male-only Corset and Boots drop when Oz dies in Phidoch Great Hall chapter
3, but only when you replay in world. They won't drop in the CODA 4 battle.

The Abyss I & II scrolls can be found in Palace of the Dead, but are easily 
missed. Abyss I drops in the pre-Fortress battle with the Lich, Water Shrine.
One of the Ghost Witches has it, but only when replaying in world. Abyss II 
can be found in world in a special battle against Xapan in Golyat: You need to
have rescued him before, and refused to recruit him. The battle is only 
available in lawful path. The Witch present in the battle drops it.

--- Missables
Only titles are considered missable in this game, but there are also 3 items 
that will no longer drop once your party is beyond a certain level. Since 
Denam must be present in STORY battles, you can't just recruit a bunch of 
low level monster classes you neglected, to pick these up later. If Denam 
has no more low level classes available to him, then you missed your chance.
-Crescente bow: Numerous random & story Archers between levels 24 and 26.
Sharp and Cold the Stars, Hanging Gardens. Disappears after level 34.
After getting one, I saw some in Wonder at the Gods Above, Phorampa Wildwood.
-Treatise on Seduction: Demonpetal Dance for Swordmaster. Chapter 4 Barnicia 
Grand Staircase, from Neutral Swordmaster Templar. Disappears at level 26.
Enraptured Dreams, Hanging Gardens. Disappears after level 34.
-Scroll of the Cicada: Decoy for Ninja. Hagia Banhamuba (vs. Sherri). Drops 
from one of the male Ninjas - the one with lower loyalty up to level 26.
Chapter 4 Heim Courtyard. Drops from male Ninja next to wizard <lvl27.
Ebon Stair, Hanging Gardens. Drops from Kunoichi Templar. Disappears @lvl35.
Thanks go to BM Sirius for quoting the strategy guide, and ronin7997 for
dispelling rumours that the Hanging Gardens drops stop appearing after lvl26.
- Wicce class: This seems to have been overlooked. Many people think it's OK
to just recruit Deneb as a Witch, because getting 30 Glass Pumpkins is a lot 
of work after having recruited 27 dragons already. But this is one thing that
cannot be remedied by traveling back in world, because Deneb will no longer
appear in her shop after she is recruited in your roster. Even when traveling
back in world mode, Punkin will be running her store. You'd need to remove
Deneb from your roster to reactivate her quest. An unappealing prospect if you
invested a lot of time into your Deneb unit.

--- Rare steals
-Classmarks for Knight Commamder: can be stolen from Zombie Templars during 
rain at the Reisan Way. You need to have Ozma already.
-Priest classmarks: Stolen from clerics on the 1st map of Phorampa Wldwood, 
Adventurer's Gap.
-Reaver: Stolen from Grim Reaper in Scenic Knoll (Phorampa Wildwood). Requires 
rank 3 Steal, and item gives +2 Steal. The ring is not unique, so you can get
more than 1 of them. Since it can cast Boon of Swiftness three times in battle,
and has Stopproof effect, it is very useful on any class. Getting rank 3 Steal
is a very tedious & difficult task. Here are some tips on how I did it:

--- About Fortify, Strengthen & Spellcraft
Rumours that Fortify is useless were based on the fact that it only helps if
you have a *very* low defense, which is only true in the early chapters.
There are also cases where Strengthen and Spellcraft become useless, but
this happens much less quickly.

Special thanks to sEmesextrEm for posting helpful links, as well as providing
support during hostile discussions.
And a big shout out to all you trolls out there! I have mixed feelings when
I need to defend myself on the boards. Any news is good news, as the saying
goes. By attacking my credibility, you add to my exposure. There's no better
way to get to know an author than when he's responding to personal attacks.

Thanks for reading, everyone. I hope it's of some use to people for 
evaluating the classes, and advanced planning for skills.
